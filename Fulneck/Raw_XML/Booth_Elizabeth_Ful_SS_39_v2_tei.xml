					<l>Elizh Booth</l>
					<l>I was born Sep<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> 22 1735 at Mirfeild My parents</l>
					<l>belonged The Church of Eng<hi rend='superscript:true;'>l</hi>, in My younger y<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi></l>
					<l>I came into a Concern about My Salvation &amp; according</l>
					<l>to my way of Thinking had it very much at heart</l>
					<l>to please the Lord in hopes that he wou&apos;d save</l>
					<l>me, in My 6 year I had a particular Impression</l>
					<l>from a dream were I saw our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> in My room I</l>
					<l>went to him &amp; askd him to bless me me, he told me</l>
					<l> I must be dipt in a fountain &amp; then I shoud be his</l>
					<l>which promise I never forgot</l>
					<l>when The B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rn</hi> came to preach at Fox rojd I went</l>
					<l>thither with my Mother &amp; got a Love for them</l>
					<l>when B<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Helt came to have the care of the</l>
					<l>Children His Meeting was a great peculiarly blessed to</l>
					<l>my heart &amp; in particular when he Spoak of our</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> death &amp; Suffering to purchas our Salvation</l>
					<l>I was very much affected thereby &amp; M &amp; my heart</l>
					<l>Melted into Tears, as I grew older I felt my corruption</l>
					<l>&amp; the great propensity I had to Sin Made me very</l>
					<l>dark &amp; Miserable as I thought no one was so Spoilt</l>
					<l>&amp; full of Evil as I felt My Self altho I had a Love</l>
					<l>for Sin yet through disstress of mind I was fridened</l>
					<l>from commiting of gross Sins &amp; instead of going to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> as a </l>
					<l>Sinner I fell to Self working &amp; striving to belief</l>
					<l>but coud attain no consolation for my Soul by it.</l>
					<l>I often use<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> to walk alone &amp; pour out my concerns before</l>
					<l>the Lord but Still preceived that my Missery increased</l>
					<l>&amp; felt as If I shoud be condemd &amp; lost forever beleiving</l>
					<l>it Impossable for our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> to have Mercy upon such</l>
					<l>a wretch as Me in this My Disstress<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> Condition</l>
				</lg>

				<lg>
					<l>I was visited by the Sisters to them I Spoke My whole</l>
					<l>heart as well as I cou&apos;d &amp; beg&apos;d them to tell me If there</l>
					<l>was Grace &amp; Mercy for me they comforted &amp; incouraged</l>
					<l>me Much &amp; told me that it was our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Grace that </l>
					<l>made such deep disscoveries of my Sinfulness that</l>
					<l>he Might Heal &amp; Save Me, but I being of a reasoning </l>
					<l>turn of Mind Soon doubted of the realitie of this &amp; woud</l>
					<l>not be comforted any other way then by our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>Manifesting himself personably to My heart as</l>
					<l>Clearly as If I saw him with My bodily Eyes</l>
					<l>I wou&apos;d believe my Sins forgiven.</l>
					<l>I continued in a heavy Course for a Considerable</l>
					<l>Time through My unbeleive of Heart not withstanding</l>
					<l>my dearest Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> never Left me his poor Child but</l>
					<l>followed me with unwearied patience but in </l>
					<l>My 17 year I began to grow tired of my own attempts</l>
					<l>to help my Self &amp; thought If perish I will now perish</l>
					<l>at My Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> feet</l>
					<l>one day when I was praying our</l>
					<l>Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> to take me as I am I had no sooner given my</l>
					<l>Self into the hands of my redeemer, but he was pleased to mani</l>
					<l>fest himself to me, &amp; Stood So Clearly before My heart</l>
					<l>&amp; Eyes in His wound figure so that I was quite Struck</l>
					<l>&amp; overcome with his Beauty. here I felt the <unclear>assurance</unclear></l>
					<l>of the forgiveness of all My Sins by which My great distress</l>
					<l>of heart &amp; mind was quite removed Oh how I felt I shall</l>
					<l>never forget my heart was quite captivated by my bloody</l>
					<l>freind who was now becomed my Only Object I can</l>
					<l>never Express in words what peace &amp; Life My poor</l>
					<l>heart injoyd for I Say of a truth when in his</l>
					<l>blood I saw him Swim a Small drop I did get, which free<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi></l>
					<l>him to me me to him the first time that we meet,</l>
				</lg>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lg>
					<l>After This a desire arose in My heart to be receivd</l>
					<l>into The congregation tho&apos; I felt My Self very unworthy</l>
					<l>of that Grace Therefore I said nothing of it to my Labourer I Spoke Childlikely to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi></l>
					<l>about it leaving it at the Same Time to his decision</l>
					<l>being very Timerous of myself Least Least I </l>
					<l>Shou<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> not prove unseen &amp; faithfull to that happy lot of Grace to our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi>, &amp; his people</l>
					<l>however not withstanding all my unstillness our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> Grantd</l>
					<l>Me that favour on nov. 13<hi rend='superscript:true;'>th</hi> 1752 here I gave My Self anew</l>
					<l>to become a joy unto our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>r</hi> &amp; his congregation in the</l>
					<l>beginning of the year 53 I had recieved the <unclear>?????</unclear> news brought</l>
					<l>Me, that I had leave to come into The Choirhouse &amp; My long</l>
					<l>wish<hi rend='superscript:true;'>d</hi> for desire was attaind on feb 3. And on the 13of aug<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi></l>
					<l>I was receved into The Single S<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> Choir on this day on this to me</l>
					<l>Ever Memorable day I devoted myself anew in</l>
					<l>with Soul &amp; body to My Manhood only Spouse to</l>
					<l>become a true virgin to him</l>
					<l>in the year 53 Sep<hi rend='superscript:true;'>t</hi> 9 I had the unspeakable Grace</l>
					<l>to become a participant of our Sav<hi rend='superscript:true;'>rs</hi> body &amp; blood in</l>
					<l>the holy Communon, This melted me like wax in</l>
					<l>the dust befe at My Bridegooms feet Thus I went</l>
