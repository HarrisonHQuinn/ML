						<roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> Grace, he once during a <name

								rend="superscript">r</hi>
							<lb/> Inghams</persName> became particularly happy, thro&apos; the
							<roleName type="honorific">holy Ghosts</roleName>
						<lb/> applying the Word to his heart. When <persName>M<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi> Spangenberg</persName>
						<lb/> went about settling Societies in these Districts he became <lb/> a
						Member of the same. He having a great Love for the <lb/>
						<orgName>Church</orgName> he was brought up in and being now more clear in
						<lb/> what one went properly to divine Service for, he continued <lb/> going
						to Church for a long while believing that our <roleName type="honorific"
								>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<lb/> blessed him there like wise. But as his Heart could be <lb/> no more
						satisfied without Fellowship, and he not meeting <lb/> with it there, this
						determined him to follow solely and <lb/> alone the Track our dear <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Might lead
						him among <lb/> the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, in
						which Resolution he was very steady, until <lb/> he was <name
							event="reception">recieved</name> into the <orgName en="congregation"
								>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, which came to pass
							<date when-iso="1748-08-13">Augst 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							<lb/> 1748</date> on account of which Grace he was very much melted
						<lb/> and thankful. <date when-iso="1748-11-13">In the same Year, namely the
								13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Novr</date>
						<lb/> he went with the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName> to the <name event="communion">holy
							Comunion</name> for the first <lb/> time, and as he has never
						enjoy&apos;d it before in his Life <lb/> time out of a profound Respect he
						had for the same, His <lb/> Heart was so much the more bowed on account of
						this <lb/> great Grace and concerning which he said: No Tongue <lb/> is able
						to express the feeling of my Heart, that such <lb/> a poor Worm as me, is
						permitted to enjoy this highest <lb/> Treasure. This Awefull Impression of
						the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name>
						<lb/> abade with him to the End of his Life. An accidental <lb/>
						Circumstance proved the Occasion to determine him and <lb/> his Wife to

						dwelling, which was <lb/>
						<date when-iso="1759-05-12">May the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							1759</date>. His Grace Election was very important <lb/> to him and
						which he kept continually in his Eye, and when <lb/> he had the Favour to
						become <name office="disciple">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
							Disceple</name>, which Dignity <lb/> he was twice invested with, his
						heart was so humbled <lb/> and broken because of the Sense of his
						unworthiness that <lb/> he went to his <name relation="son">Son</name>
						<persName>James</persName>, entreated him to assist him <lb/> in praying our
						dear <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						that His Intention with him <lb/> might be obtained. In his Course and Walk,
						this in <lb/> a Measure unobserved, he enjoy&apos;d much of our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName>
						<lb/> Love and Grace, and so as he grew weaker and <lb/> feebler in his Body
						his Tenderness towards his <lb/>
						<roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName> encreased, and his Longing to
						be soon with <lb/> him grew more ardant. He was often seen weeping <lb/>
						when by himself, and if asked what was the Cause <lb/> of at, he said: <name
							type="emotion">These are not Tears of Sorrow, but <lb/> Tears of Love to
							my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName></name>. When he was the
						<lb/> last time at the <name event="communion">holy Comunion</name> in the
							<placeName>Hall</placeName>, he had <lb/> an Intimation of it that this
						would be the last time <lb/> he should enjoy that greatest of Blessings here
						below; <lb/> But heartily wished that he might have no long and <lb/>
						serious sickness in order not to give his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript"
								>rn</hi></orgName> any <lb/> trouble, which Request be clear
							<roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> granted him <lb/> like wise:
						for when on the <date type="death" when-iso="1759-12-16">16<hi
								rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec.</date> he went to <lb/> Bed about
						9 o&apos;Clock in the Evening, he slept till about <lb/> 1 o&apos;Clock in
						the Morning, and at 2 o&apos;Clock his Soul </p>

						Life lasted 75 Years. </p>
