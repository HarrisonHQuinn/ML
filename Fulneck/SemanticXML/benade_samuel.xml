					<p> Hear then, what the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> has done for my <lb/> Soul! </p>
					<p> I was <name event="birth" when-iso="1746-10-28">born</name> the <date when="1746-10-28" cert="high">28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of October 1746</date> at <lb/>

						My Father was <lb/> the <name memoirSubject="n" office="#mloff000002">Minister</name> of the place, and my Mother <lb/>
						<persName ref="#mlper000720" cert="high" type="real">Christiana</persName>, whose maiden name was Faber <lb/> a <name memoirSubject="n" office="#mloff000002">Minister</name>'s daughter. These

						<roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, and <lb/> to prerserve them from this present evil world <lb/> &amp;
						from the spirit of seduction. Wherefore, <lb/> getting acquainted with the
						<orgName religion="Moravian Church">Brethren</orgName>, <lb/> who frequently passed thro' the village <lb/> in going from
						<placeName ref="#mlpla000152" cert="high">Kleinwelke</placeName> to <placeName ref="#mlpla000250" cert="high">Uhyst</placeName>, they <lb/> soon embraced that opportunity, to place
						<lb/> us, one after another, in the Seminaries <lb/> of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, and thus in my eigth year <lb/> I came to

					</p>
					<p> It was high time for me to be then brought <lb/> to a place of safety; for
						young &amp; little as I <lb/> was, the evil propensities of the heart began
						<lb/> already to unfold themselves and would have <lb/> even without the aid
						of seduction, rushed <lb/> into activity, if they had not been restrained.

					<p> <date cert="medium" when="1759">In my 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year</date> I was placed in the Pae- <lb/>

					<p> In 1759 I was received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. &amp;
						<lb/> in 1761 admitted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. This
						divine <lb/> repast has been of blessed reality &amp; help to me <lb/> in my

					<p> object of his divine, infinite and unbounded <lb/> love, and that it was the
						gracious purpose of <lb/> his love, to grant me a full portion of that sal-
						<lb/> vation, which he has purchased for all and <lb/> this impression has
						never left me since, proving <lb/> a powerful support to me under various
						trial <lb/> and tribulations. </p>
					<p> In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. year I was appointed Teacher <lb/> in
						the Paedagogium at Niesky, where I spent <lb/> 4 years very pleasantly; my
						labor among <lb/> the youths, whom I dearly loved, being easy <lb/> and
						agreeable to me, and my fellowshep with <lb/> our Savior childlike and
						familiar. During <lb/> that time I had a very painful fit of the gout, <lb/>
						occasioned by an obstinate cold, wch I had <lb/> neglected in the beginning. </p>
					<p> Upon this truly delightful period followed <lb/> a time of trial and
						distiess, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>. I brought <lb/> upon myself by
						indulging a mistaken notion <lb/> that I should to more useful in our
						Savior's <lb/> cause, if I went out of the common track, <lb/> and that my
						faith would carry me through <lb/> all difficulties. When I afterwards
						discovered <lb/> the fallacy of my conceptions, &amp; the true source <lb/>
						from w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> they had spiring, the pride of my <lb/>
						heart, and a desire to render myself eminent &amp; <lb/> conspicuous; I was

					<p> and at time so cast down that it required <lb/> strong and repeated
						consolations, to lift me up <lb/> again. Under these circumstance the Holy
						<lb/> Ghost created me with maternal tenderness <lb/> and attention,
						discovering to me on the one <lb/> hand more than ever the deep depravity of
						<lb/> my heart as the source of all Evil, and on the <lb/> other the
						unchangeable love &amp; friendships <lb/> of my Savior; administering at the
						same <lb/> time the balm of divine consolation to my <lb/> broken and
						contrite heart. It was then that <lb/> I made a blessed experience of that
						precious <lb/> truth, that all things must work together <lb/> for good to
						them that love God. For this <lb/> trial not only served to confirm my
						faith, <lb/> but also to prepare me for my future calling <lb/> to preach
						the Gospel and to labor in the <lb/> Lord's vineyard. </p>
					<p> In the year 1772, having been accepted an <lb/> Acoluth in the UEC, I was
						appointed to the <lb/> service of the Boys Oeconomy at Fulneck <lb/> in
						Yorkshire. As I had to travel alone, and <lb/> part of the way thro'
						England, unable to <lb/> speak the language, I experienced new proofs <lb/>
						of a gracious providence watching over me <lb/> for good, and answering the
						prayers of a lone- <lb/> ly traveller. <note type="catchword">The</note>

					<p> The first year of my service at Fulneck <lb/> was extremely heavy to me, as
						I found the <lb/> circumstances of the Oeconomy so difficult <lb/> and
						embarrassed, that I could see no remedy <lb/> either one way of another.
						Nevertheless, I put <lb/> my trust in the Lord, and firmly believed, <lb/>
						that he in his own good time would bring <lb/> things into a better course,
							w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> also came to <lb/> pass, when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Traneker came as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
						<lb/> Helper to Fulneck and undertook the ma- <lb/> nagement of the
						Oeconomy. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> In the second year after my arrival in <lb/> England, I was appointed to
						preach occasion- <lb/> ally in country places about Fulneck, which <lb/>
						indeed was a difficult task to me, both on <lb/> account of my insufficient
						knowledge of <lb/> the language, and on account of my natural <lb/> timidity
						and bashfulness. But He, whose <lb/> strength is made perfect in weakness,
						and <lb/> who regards the poor and needy, supported <lb/> me in every time
						of need, and if I felt po- <lb/> verty of spirit it was for the blesing of
						my <lb/> own heart. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> Amidst all outward difficulties I had a <lb/> blessed time at Fulneck. I
						counted it grace, <lb/> to advance in the knowledge of my deep de- <lb/>
						pravity, as it was a powerful inducement <lb/>

					<p> to me, to come with prayer &amp; supplication <lb/> to the Savior of
						Sinners, and to claim the <lb/> healing virtue of his precious blood, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I <lb/> also experienced according to my
						faith: <lb/> At times indeed I felt the power of sin &amp; <lb/> the
						strength of unbelief to such a degree, <lb/> that I was prompted to despair
						of a com- <lb/> pleat deliverance; but even then "he delivered <lb/> my soul
						from death, mine eyes from tears, <lb/> and my feet from falling", and
						granted me <lb/> again a time of refreshing from his presence <lb/> Once on
						such an occasion I was most bless- <lb/> edly relieved by a divine
						assurance, that not <lb/> withstanding all my sinfulness I should <lb/> yet
						attain to that supreme happiness, to <lb/> love my Savior with all my heart,
						with all <lb/> my strength and with all my undesrstand<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>
						<lb/> and to be perfectly renewed into his image. <lb/> The labor among the
						Children appeared to <lb/> me highly important, &amp; I found much <lb/>
						occasion, to ask for grace and wisdom to <lb/> do justice to the several
						duties incumbent <lb/> upon me. I trust my labor has been of be- <lb/> nefit
						to some of them; but at any rate it has <lb/> been made a blessing to my own

					<p> Savior and Redeemer, who has delivered my <lb/> Soul from the pit of
						corruption, and is become <lb/> to me a never failing source of comfort,
						peace <lb/> and joy. Thus a grand view of nature proved <lb/> the occasion
						of an animating manifestation of <lb/> of divine love. </p>
					<p> Another instance is this. For a consider- <lb/> able time my heart had been
						as cold as ice, and <lb/> dead as a stone, altho' I was not particularly <lb/>
						<add place="above">harrassed</add> by tempitations, or the workings of my

						lamentable state, I had neither power <lb/> nor inclination to pray for a
						change, &amp; for <lb/> a return of my former blessed &amp; tender feeling.
						<lb/> In this state I took a solitary walk into a <lb/> wood, and laid
						myself, dead &amp; cold as I was <lb/> at the feet of my Savior and cried:
						"Lord, <lb/> have mercy upon me." It was not long before <lb/> such a
						transition took place, as if I had been <lb/> translated from darkness into
						light, &amp; from <lb/> death into life, God revealed himself to me <lb/> in
						his unspeakable love. And O! how often <lb/> has he by an unexpected touch,

					<p> on the point of deviating from the right <lb/> path and going astray, and if
						at any time. <lb/> my frail nature had swerved beyond the <lb/> proper
						bounds, he soon created in me a god- <lb/> ly sorrow on account of it, and
						then again <lb/> filled my heart with peace and comfort. <lb/> During my
						stay at Fulneck I experienced <lb/> a particular prresenation of my life.
						Being <lb/> one Sunday sent to Baildon to preach, I <lb/> took a short road,
						where I had to cross a small <lb/> river, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>,
						in dry weather is fordable on step- <lb/> ping stones, but was now <add place="above">so</add> swelled by the rain <lb/> that it could only be
						crossed over in a boat. <lb/> The ferryman having gone to Church, a <lb/>
						stout looking boy offered to ferry me over &amp; <lb/> we set off, but when
						we had got into the <lb/> middle of the stream, he found it so rapid <lb/>
						that he lost the command of the boat, &amp; was <lb/> obliged to let it go
						down with the current, <lb/> which carried us into a mill race, &amp;
						brought <lb/> us to the very edge of the mill dam, from <lb/> which the
						superfluous water was precipitat<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>
						<lb/> itself into a bed of stones. We now expected <lb/> to go down the fall
						and to be dashed among <lb/> the stones wch had happened to others in this
						<lb/> place, who lost their lives, and indeed the <lb/> people came running
						from the mill &amp; the <note type="catchword">adjacent</note>
					</p>

					<p> adjacent houses, to see what would be come <lb/> of us. But when we came to
						the edge of the <lb/> fall, the boat instead of going down with <lb/> the
						torrent, gliding gently along close to the <lb/> edge, safely passed the
						waterfall, two young <lb/> men from the mill then got into the boat, <lb/>
						and ferried me safe over the river. Having <lb/> thus received, as it were,
						my life anew out <lb/> of the hand of God, I dedicated it anew to <lb/> him,
						to spend it in his service &amp; to his glory. <lb/> In the year 1770 I was
						called to Dublin, <lb/> these to have the care of the single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and <lb/> Boys, including the Children, as
						also to <lb/> assist in preaching. Previous to my setting <lb/> out I was
						ordained a Deacon of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
						<lb/> Church by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Johannes de Watteville then
						<lb/> on a visit at Fulneck. </p>
					<p> During my 5 years service in that Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, <lb/> I
						experienced much patience, long-suffering <lb/> &amp; forbearance, but also
						much grace &amp; favor <lb/> from my bountiful Lord. Many temptations <lb/>
						indeed from the side of an evil world presented <lb/> themselves to my view
						&amp; I had no power <lb/> in myself to resist, but rather found my <lb/>
						treacherous heart but too ready and prone <lb/> to engage in unprofitable
						things; but I cried <lb/> to the Lord in my distress, &amp; he heard my cry

					<p> and delivered me in every time of need, <lb/> As the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. at that time was desirous, that <lb/> a Boys
						day school should be instituted under <lb/> the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> direction and management, I was <lb/> glad of being servicable

						came from the <lb/> Lord. But it lasted till February following, <lb/>
						before I could set out on my passage to Ger- <lb/> many. Several occurrences
						render'd this jour- <lb/> ney very remarkable. First I lost all my <lb/>
						goods, when the Ship, in which I was send- <lb/> ing them from Dublin to
						London, was wrecked <lb/> on the Welsh Coast, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> loss however did not <lb/> affect me much as my immediate wants

					<p> by the ice living the coast, and requiring <lb/> ice boats to land the
						passengers, it was but <lb/> just cleared of the ice when I had to go over.
						<lb/> The ice having been stopped both in the <lb/> Rhine and in the Elbe,
						dreadful inunda- <lb/> tions had ensued, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>
						rendered the roads im- <lb/> passable, and when I left Zeist it was with
						<lb/> the first post waggon that could travel, &amp; <lb/> still in several
						places the road was intersected <lb/> by the water. Thus I saw a hand of
						provi- <lb/> dence in it, that my setting out from Dublin <lb/> had been so
						long delayed. But when I had <lb/> reached the bo<del>a</del>rders of
						Germany, the winter <lb/> set in again, it snowed day and night and <lb/>
						the roads were rendered nearly impracticable. <lb/> One night we actually
						stuck fast in the snow <lb/> and we could not have been extricated, if there
						<lb/> had not been another carriage in company, <lb/> whose horses joined to
						ours rescued us from our <lb/> disagreable situation. In short, I had so
						<lb/> much to suffer from cold, sickness and fatigue <lb/> that when at last
						I reached Barby in the <lb/> beginning of April, my heart was full of <lb/>
						thanks and praises for my presentation, and <lb/> I found my faith and

						<lb/> at Neusalz, and having been ordained a <lb/> Presbyter by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spangenberg, I arrived there <lb/> with my
						wife, who was then pregnant, the <lb/> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of
						March, after a difficult and hazardous <lb/> journey, the snow being
						uncommonly deep. <lb/> The state of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
						whom we came to <lb/> serve, was such, that we might have been <lb/>
						discouraged from undertaking the office <lb/> if our Lord had not supported
						us with the <lb/> believing hope, that he would be with us, <lb/> &amp;
						bless our service which hope was in the <lb/> sequel realised beyond our
						expectation. </p>
					<p> In 1785 the Lord blessed us with the birth <lb/> of a Son, whom we dedicated
						unto Him <lb/> as his blood bought property. </p>
					<p> But now began a scene of domestic distress, <lb/> w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> under <del>a</del> various changes &amp; vicissitudes, <lb/>
						lasted till the happy departure of my be- <lb/> loved wife, who during a
						period of 6 years <lb/> had to endure one sickness after another, <lb/>
						&amp; even in the intervals did not enjoy any <lb/> comfortable state of
						health. The early de- <lb/> parture of our little Son who for half a <lb/>
						year labored under a gradual decline, con- <lb/> tributed much to the injury
						of her frame, <lb/> as she took it much to heart. </p>

					<p> During this period I was often harrassed <lb/> by such a variety and
						multiplicity of distresses <lb/> and perplexiting circumstances, that I
						should <lb/> have been quite unfit for the duties of my office <lb/> and the
						service of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, if our Savior <lb/> had
						not supported me in an extraordinary <lb/> manner, next to wch the love and
						kindness <lb/> we experienced from our B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp;
							S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> was also <lb/> a great help and benefit
						to us. </p>
					<p> In the beginning of 1789 we were called <lb/> upon to officiate during the
						Synod at Gna <lb/> denfrey, while both the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
						Helper &amp; the <lb/> Minister of that Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
						were attending the <lb/> Synod. My dear wife was but just recovering <lb/>
						from a severe illness, and still so weak, that <lb/> she could not cross the
						room without help <lb/> nevertheless we accepted the call in reliance <lb/>
						upon our Savior's support, who graciously <lb/> answered our prayers on that
						occasion. <lb/> Our short residence at Gnadenfrey was in- <lb/> deed
						attended with much labor and fatigue, <lb/> but we also experienced much of
						our Savior's <lb/> help in time of need, &amp; were strengthened by <lb/>
						the mutual support of our fellow labourers <lb/> and the general love of the
							B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>,
						so that <lb/> our hearts overflowed with thanks and praises <lb/> when in
						the spring 1790 we set out for England, <note type="catchword">having</note>

					<p> having been appointed by the Synod La <lb/> borers of the London Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> We arrived in London in June following <lb/> Here we had again to pass thro'
						a variety of <lb/> new &amp; heavy trials; the increasing sickliness <lb/>
						of my wife soon disabled her from attending <lb/> her office, and terminated
						at last in a confirmed <lb/> decline. This and other distresses had such
						<lb/> an effect upon my whole frame, that I <lb/> felt sick and was again
						brought nigh unto <lb/> death. The Lord however blessed the means <lb/> used
						for my recovery, and strengthened me <lb/> anew, to administer my last help
						to my dear <lb/> wife now hastening to her dissolution, and <lb/> to wait
						upon her, till she was permitted to <lb/> enter into her eternal rest. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> At the close of this period taking a retrospect- <lb/> ing view of the
						various afflicting dispensations <lb/> I had passed thro', and which at
						times seemed <lb/> to bear to hard upon me, I could thank our <lb/> Savior
						with heartfelt gratitude for all the de- <lb/> monstrations of his love and
						goodness, and for <lb/> causing all things to work together for my good
						<lb/> I am fully convinced from my own experience <lb/> that He doth all
						things well, that all his chast- <lb/> enings on love, and that our short
						affliction <lb/> w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> is but for a moment,
						worketh a far more <lb/>

					<p> exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while <lb/> we look not at the things
							w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> are seen, but at <lb/> the things w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> are not seen. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> After the happy departure of my late Wife <lb/> in January 1792 I spent one
						year as a Wi- <lb/> dower, and our Savior granted me a time of <lb/>
						refreshing rest. In September the same year <lb/> I received an appointment,
						to serve the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
						<lb/> at Bedford, but circumstances delayed my <lb/> going thither till the
						year following. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> On the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. April 1793 I was married to the <lb/>
						S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jane Dodgson, and soon after we went <lb/>
						to Bedford. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> Our stay there was upon the whole very <lb/> agreeable, and we richly
						enjoyed the blessing <lb/> of God, and the love and confidence of our B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
						<lb/> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>. We had indeed also our share of
						diffi- <lb/> culties, but the Lord helped us thro' them all. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> When we found ourselves quite comfortably <lb/> settled, we received a Call
						to Dublin, and ar- <lb/> rived there in December 1794. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> As we both had served this Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> before, <lb/>
						tho' in different capacities, &amp; pretty well <lb/> knew beforehand, what
						difficulties awaited <lb/> us to encounter, we felt rather heavy on that
						<lb/> account, but nevertheless, trusted in the <lb/> Lord, that he would
						continue to support us, <lb/>
						<note type="catchword">as</note>
					</p>

					<p> as he had done hitherto. Nor was our confi- <lb/> dence put to shame, and
						amidst our own <lb/> infirmities, and various trials we had to pass <lb/>
						thro' we enjoyed much grace and blessing <lb/> from our Savior, and his
						gracious support <lb/> in every time of need. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> One of the heaviest trials, which occurred <lb/> during this period, was
						that dreadful re- <lb/> bellion, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> while it
						lasted, raged with sa- <lb/> vage fury, and more than once threatened <lb/>
						destruction to the City of Dublin. It was well <lb/> for us, not to know the
						full extent of the <lb/> dangers we were surrounded with tho' we <lb/> were
						also frequently alarmed by false reports <lb/> and needless apprehensions.
						Frequently the <lb/> state of things was such, that our lives seem'd <lb/>
						to hang by a slender thread, and on several <lb/> occasions it was a serious
						question, we had <lb/> to put to ourselves, whether we were duly <lb/>
						prepared to meet the impending fate, tho' <lb/> we should be carried off by
						a sudden stroke. <lb/> Our hope was in the Lord, who heard our <lb/> humble
						prayers and supplications for the <lb/> good of the country, and granted a
						happy <lb/> issue to that awful contest w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, if
						it had <lb/> terminated in the intended revolution &amp; sub- <lb/> version
						of the existing Government, would <lb/>

					<p> would have occasioned scenes of unparalled <lb/> cruelty, massacre and
						devastation. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> We were thankful to the Lord, that we not <lb/> only <add place="above">could</add> possess our own Souls in patience, but also <lb/>
						administer comfort and encouragement to others. <lb/> During that time I
						also experienced a remark- <lb/> able preservation from bodily harm, having
						<lb/> my legs nearly crushed by a brewer's dray drive- <lb/> ing against a
						jaunting car, in w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I was sitting <lb/>
						sideways. The injury I received was however <lb/> such, that for a
						considerable time I was pre- <lb/> vented officiating in the Church. But far
						<lb/> more important was the preservation of my <lb/> Soul in the midst of
						so many temptations <lb/> abounding in such a large City, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I could <lb/> by no means overcome by my own
						strength, <lb/> but solely by looking unto Jesus the Author <lb/> &amp;
						Finisher of my faith. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> And let me here observe again, that for <lb/> the most part of my life
						scarcely a day has <lb/> passed, when I had not some humbling <lb/> sense
						&amp; symptom of the vileness &amp; depravity <lb/> of my nature, which
						caused me to mourn &amp; <lb/> to seek help and comfort in our Savior, the
						<lb/> blessed consequence of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was, that I
						also ex- <lb/> perienced the comforts of his pardoning &amp; reviving <lb/>
						<note type="catchword">grace</note>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="page" n="25">
					<pb n="25" facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_78_BenadeSamuel-25.jpg"/>
					<p> grace. This constant need of a Savior, and <lb/> the never failing help and
						refuge I found <lb/> in Him, proved to me the reality of the <lb/> Gospel,
						and my sure interest in Christ's re- <lb/> demption. And as my experience
						tallied with <lb/> the written word of God, it confirmed my high <lb/>
						regard and veneration for the sacred oracles: <lb/> or else that stupendous
						&amp; all conception far <lb/> surpassing fact: God was manifest in the
						<lb/> flesh, and suffer'd blood and died for Sinners, <lb/> would have
						utterly confounded my reason <lb/> &amp; understanding and staggered all
						belief. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> When the Synod of 1801 had come to a close, <lb/> and I had received no
						intimation of an intended <lb/> change, I concluded, that I should continue
						<lb/> in the service of the Dublin Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp;
						therefore <lb/> devoted myself anew to the Lord for that pur- <lb/> pose.
						But while I was sitting in my room <lb/> in this happy fame of mind, the
						postman <lb/> brought a letter, contain<hi rend="superscript">g</hi> our
						appointment <lb/> to the service of Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. This indeed <lb/> came very unexpected, and was not altogether
						<lb/> agreeable to our wishes, as we were much <lb/> attached to the Dublin
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, with whom we <lb/> had shared a great
						deal of joy, as well as of <lb/> distress and trouble, particularly during
						the <lb/>

					<p> late rebellion. But having devoted ourselves <lb/> unreservedly to the
						Lord's service, &amp; promised <lb/> obedience to his will and guidance, we
						could <lb/> do no other than accept of that new appointment. <lb/> We
						arrived at Fulneck Nov. 10. 1801, and on <lb/> the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> following, on w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> day 65 years ago
						<lb/> I had experienced the first real and abiding <lb/> manifestation of
						Jesus love and grace, I was <lb/> according to a Synodal resolution,
						confirmed <lb/> by the Lord, consecrated a Bishop of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>
						<lb/> Church by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> Traneker and Moore, on
						<lb/> w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> occasion I was so overpowerd by the
						grace <lb/> of God, that wi<del>ll</del><add place="above">th</add> purpose
						of heart, and without <lb/> any reserve whatever, I surrender'd myself anew
						<lb/> to my Lord &amp; Savior and from a pure motive <lb/> of love and
						gratitude for his lovingkindness <lb/> and goodness towards me, dedicated my
						fu- <lb/> ture services to Him in that house &amp; family <lb/> of his own
						to which He had graciously led <lb/> me in my early youth. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> On this occasion it will not be improper <lb/> for me, to state my views
						respectg the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
						<lb/>
					</p>
					<p> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, to w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I have
						the favor to belong. <lb/> The Church of Christ here on earth appears <lb/>
						to me like a large and fruitful gardens, con- <lb/> sisting of a number of
						compartments or divisions <lb/>
						<note type="catchword">differing</note>
					</p>

					<p> differing indeed both in arrangement &amp; cul- <lb/> ture, but all under
						the care and managment <lb/> of one &amp; the same Gardener; who appoints
						<lb/> Laborers for each division of his garden &amp; <lb/> vineyard,
						instructing them in the proper mode <lb/> of cultivating that part which is
						exclusively <lb/> committed to them. Now it is well known, <lb/> that
						different plants require both a different <lb/> treatment and a different
						soil, &amp; would not e- <lb/> qually prosper in a soil less congenial to
						their <lb/> texture and nature. So it is with the different <lb/>
						denominations in the Christian Church. All <lb/> of them, that confess Jesus
						Christ to be their <lb/> Lord and Master, and walk in the way of his <lb/>
						precepts and commandments deriving from <lb/> him wisdom, righteousness,
						sanctification and <lb/> redemption, and keeping the word of his pa- <lb/>
						tience, belong to the Lord's vineyard, &amp; occupy <lb/> different
						compartments where they receive a <lb/> different treatment under their
						peculiar <lb/> form and constitution; there they find them- <lb/> selves at
						home and thrive best. Thus there <lb/> are many excellent Children of God,

					<p> other hand those whom our Savior has <lb/> called to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church, &amp; who are genuine <lb/> members
						of the same, could not foot themselves <lb/> at home in any other
						denomination, nor be <lb/> so much further'd in their course any where else.
						<lb/>
					</p>
					<p> This at least is my case, conviction and ex- <lb/> perience, and the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Church has proved <lb/> to me the most
						congenial soil for growing in <lb/> the grace and knowledge of our Lord
						Jesus Christ. <lb/> It is in this fold, that I have been screened and <lb/>
						secured from the deleterious influence of se- <lb/> duction, so common among
						young people when <lb/> left to themselves; it is there that I received
						<lb/> a careful education, combining the know- <lb/> ledge of spiritual
						things with useful learning <lb/> of things pertaining to this life: it is
						there that <lb/> by serving in a variety of situations &amp; passing <lb/>
						thro' various trials, peculiar to our connection <lb/> with one another, I
						was qualified both to feed <lb/> the sheep of Christ, and from my own expe-
						<lb/> rience to lead them deeper into a proper ap- <lb/> plication of the
						word of life &amp; the merits of our <lb/> Lord Jesus Christ; it is there,
						that the gifts &amp; <lb/> talents allotted to me, can be more usefully em-
						<lb/> ployed than any where else, and finally it is <lb/> there, that my
						heavenly race meets with the <lb/> least obstruction &amp; with the best
						encouragement. <lb/>

					<p> If therefore others have the same special Call, <lb/> let them obey it, and
						they will find themselves <lb/> in the right place, they will thrive &amp;
						prosper <lb/> and they will clearly see from their blessed <lb/> experience,
						that He, who has called them, is <lb/> faithful to perform the purposes of
						their call<hi rend="superscript">g</hi>
						<lb/> and election. And Oh! that our young people, <lb/> who are born and
						bred in our Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, and thus <lb/> have a clear
						Call to it, might duly reflect on <lb/> our Savior's views with them in
						regard to <lb/> their course thro' life and be duly concerned <lb/> to
						inherit the blessing of their Parents &amp; An- <lb/> cestors. And Oh! may
						the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> people never <lb/> forget, that the
						Lord has formed them for him- <lb/> self, to be his witnesses, to confess
						him among <lb/> men as the only Savior of perishing Sinners, <lb/> to be

					</p>
					<p> But to resume my Narrative. When I en- <lb/> tered upon the service of
						Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, I was <lb/> well aware of the
						multiplicity of labor, cares <lb/> and difficulties belonging to it, nor
						could I think <lb/> myself sufficient for that station, but nevertheless
						<lb/>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div type="page" n="30">
					<pb n="30" facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_78_BenadeSamuel-30.jpg"/>
					<p> I submitted to every part of my calling in <lb/> reliance upon our Saviors
						gracious support <lb/> wch. I also richly experienced under a variety of
						<lb/> heavy circumstances. In the beginning it was <lb/> a great help to me,
						that our late dear Brother <lb/> Traneker still continued for some time to
						act <lb/> as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Helper and to take some
						share in <lb/> the labor, but after his departure I had to en- <lb/> ter
						fully upon the exercise of all my functions <lb/> as Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Helper Minister &amp; Inspector of the <lb/>
						Schools. <lb/>
					</p>
					<p> Every period of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi>. Church has been <lb/>
						attended with its own peculiar difficulties <lb/> but what renders the
						office of a Laborer in <lb/> such a situation now a days more particu- <lb/>
						larly embarrassing, is the want of proper <lb/> persons for managing the
						Concerns of a Place <lb/> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>., and for
						serving our Boarding Schools <lb/> as Teachers or Assistants, or in any
						other ca- <lb/> pacity. If therefore a vacancy happens, it is <lb/> no easy
						matter to fill it up again with a <lb/> proper qualified person. At one time
						in par- <lb/> ticular this circumstance caused me much dis- <lb/> tress of
						mind, and I cried day and night to the <lb/> to the Lord for help, till it
						came from quar- <lb/> ter, from when I had least expected it. On the <lb/>
						other hand I found abundant cause to rejoice, <lb/>
						<note type="catchword">over</note>

					<p> over the blessing, which the Lord had laid <lb/> upon the Schools. For when
						I first came to <lb/> Fulneck in the year 1772, as first Teacher of <lb/>
						the Boys Oeconomy, consisting at that time <lb/> of about I Boys, I found it
						in such needy <lb/> circumstances, and so low in the estimation <lb/> of
						others, that it required much patience to <lb/> endure it, and much faith to
						hope for better <lb/> times. And on my return in the year 1801 <lb/> I found
						a School of about 70 Boys settled <lb/> in a new house built for the
						purpose, and <lb/> another of upwards of 50 Girls occuping the <lb/> lower
						apartments under the Chapel, placed <lb/> under our care in easy
						circumstances This <lb/> was to me a most striking proof, that the <lb/>
						Lord sees our tears, hears our prayers, &amp; in <lb/> due time grants our
						petitions, yet doth ex- <lb/> ceeding abundantly above all that we can ask
						<lb/> or think, for his own name's sake. My only <lb/> wish and prayer was,
						that we might be able, <lb/> to do justice to our important calling. And
						<lb/> in this respect, as all others, I was heartily <lb/> thankful to our
						Saviors and admired his <lb/> gracious leading, that in my dear wife he-
						<lb/> had given me a partner, well qualified for <lb/> our station and
						respective employments </p>
					<p> In the year 1810 I was brought very low and </p>

					<p> and much reduced by a slow nervous fever <lb/> w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> almost incapacitated me for any time <lb/> but still I was not
						entirely laid up, &amp; could <lb/> transact the most urgent matters. </p>
					<p> Our service in Fulneck, arduous &amp; laborious <lb/> at best, on account of
						the multiplicity of our <lb/> incumbencies, was in the 2 last years rendered
						<lb/> still more<hi rend="superscript"> </hi>so by the misfortunes,
						occasioned by <lb/> the spirit of speculation in trade, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was <lb/> then prevailing throughout the
						mercantile <lb/> community and was the cause of innume- <lb/> table ruinous
						failures. The reproach, which <lb/> then, tho' undeservedly; fall upon the
							Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>
						<lb/> and its Servants, and other highly distressing <lb/> circumstances
						bore heavy upon our minds <lb/> but at the same time we were so strengthen'd
						<lb/> by the Lord, and supported by his powerful <lb/> aid, that we were
						able to bear up under <lb/> all trials and difficulties </p>
					<p> Upon the whole, when we survey our 11 <lb/> years residence and labor in
						Fulneck, our <lb/> hearts are filled with gratitude for the in- <lb/>
						numerable proofs of the unchangeable love. <lb/> grace and mercy of our Lord
						and Master, ex- <lb/> perienced both in our private course, &amp; in <lb/>
						our official labors. Nor is it the least of his <lb/> favors, that he
						counted us worthy, to serve <note type="catchword">not</note>

					<p> not only the Fulneck Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, but also its <lb/>
						dependencies, the rest of our Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> in York-
						<lb/> shire, and their numerous Schools. </p>
					<p> In the year 1<del>7</del><add place="above">8</add>11 we received our Call
						to Ire- <lb/> land, where, besides our, joint offices, I was <lb/> to
						succeed our late B<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Hartley in that of <lb/>
							Prov.<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Helper of Ireland, &amp; Minister of
						Grace- <lb/> hill; but it lasted till October 1812, before <lb/> we could
						set out for our new post where we <lb/> arrived on the 14<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of that month. </p>
					<p> In this new situation I feel again every day <lb/> anew the absolute
						necessity, to look to Jesus <lb/> the Author and Finisher of my faith, that
						I may <lb/> not only be preserved from sin and the evils of <lb/> a corrupt
						nature, but also grow up in his like- <lb/> ness in all things. along with
						an humbling <lb/> sense of the entire depravity of soul &amp; body, <lb/>
						and the constant need of a Physician, &amp; under <lb/> a deep conviction,
						that I am not worthy of <lb/> the least of all his mercies, I am favored
						with <lb/> a high conception of my heavenly calling <lb/> and election of
						grace, and of the infinite worth <lb/> of that crown of life, which the
						Lord, the <lb/> righteous Judge, shall give unto all them <lb/> that love
						his appearing. But oh!, how often <lb/> do I feel an unaccountable
						listlessness, and <lb/> must blame myself for culpable tardiness </p>

					<p> in pursueing that holiness without which <lb/> no man shall see the Lord.

						<lb/> What shall I say of the year that is now <lb/> gone by. it was indeed
						a period of many se- <lb/> vere trials of various kinds, but the greatest
						<lb/> of all was, that on the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of August it
						pleased <lb/> the Lord, to take home to himself my beloved <lb/> partner and
						faithful helpmate, with whom <lb/> I had lived in the married state 25
						years, &amp; <lb/> who not only was a pleasant companion <lb/> to me but
						also an experienced Assistant in <lb/> the labor, having already previous to
						our <lb/> marriage served a number of years as a faith <lb/> full handmaid
						of the Lord among the Girls <lb/> and single Sister. Thus I was now the 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>
						<lb/> time placed in the state of a Widower at <lb/> a time of life, when
						such an agreeable com- <lb/> panion and faithful helpmnate is doubly <lb/>
						valuable. My desire was now more than <lb/> ever fixed upon things above,
						&amp; upon being <lb/> at home with the Lord. </p>
					<p> I had also some expectation at the close <lb/> of the Syned held this year
						at Herrnhut, <lb/> that I should be permitted to lay down my <lb/> offices

						<lb/> before his happy departure. Since that time <lb/> his health are

					<p> accustomed to do in his garden, and con <lb/> fined him almost entirely to
						his room. He <lb/> was no more able so take a part in the delibera <lb/>
						tions of the E.C. which he have previously attended <lb/> with great
						faithfulness &amp; interest, whenever <lb/> his health would permit; and his
						intimate <lb/> acquaintance with the official concerns of <lb/> the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and those of the Irish Province during <lb/>
						his residence of 18 years in Gracehill qualified <lb/> him for rendering at
						times very effectual aid <lb/> in these consultations. </p>
					<p> A fit of the gout to which he was subject <lb/> in winter had usually the
						effect of renewing <lb/> his health so that he could enjoy the latter <lb/>
						half of the year with comfort, employing <lb/> himself in reading, writing,
						quite exercise <lb/> in his gardens enjoying the Society <lb/> of his fellow
						labourers; but in the last <lb/> year, tho' not altogether free from the
						gout at <lb/> times, he does not appear to have had strength <lb/> of
						constitution to throw it out. In the place <lb/> of gouty, dropsical
						symptoms manifested <lb/> themselves and increased upon him, till <lb/> they
						proved the means of his happy departure <lb/> The direct manifestations with
						which he <lb/> was favoured from time to time of the <lb/> presence, peace,
						&amp; love of his Saviour, often <lb/> caused his heart and lips to overflow

					<p> gratitude &amp; praises; and the review of the Lords <lb/> dealings with him
						from his youth, of the <lb/> goodness &amp; mercy which had followed him
						<lb/> all the days of his life, with which he was <lb/> much occupied in his
						latter days, was fre <lb/> quently so overwhelming to him that he <lb/>

						&amp; body. The <lb/> nature of his complaint was such as to <lb/> cause him

						truth; that <lb/> they might enjoy, the comfort &amp; support them <lb/>
						when no longer able to hear or read it. He <lb/> had taken great pains to

						testimony of a most faithful, laborious, inde <lb/> fatigable, and blessed
						servant of the Lord, <lb/> who gave himself wholly to the work &amp; to
						<lb/> the ministry which he had received. </p>

					<p> to children of God of every denomination yea <lb/> to the whole human race,
						that he added to <lb/> brotherly kindness universal charity. </p>
					<p> During the last 7 years of his life he has <lb/> enjoyed an anticipation of
						that sabbatic <lb/> rest into which he has now entered, having <lb/> been
						induced by age and its consequent in <lb/> firmities to lay down his
						offices, and it was <lb/> truly delightful to see him so cheerful, contented
						<lb/> and happy in his retirement. Having finished <lb/> his work he waited
						with the most confident <lb/> power yet with the most patient resignation
						<lb/> for the happy moment when he should be <lb/> permitted to enter with
						the joy of his Lord, <lb/> as a humble pardoned sinner, whose trust <lb/>
						and dependance was in the merits, the <lb/> atonement and righteousness of
