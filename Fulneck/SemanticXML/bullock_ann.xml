							The S. S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ann Bullock who went home Feb<hi rend="superscript">y</hi> 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1771 <lb />
							had noted the following 
					</p>
					<p>
						
							I was born at Maningom <lb />
							in the Parish of Bradford aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 29 1743 of Church of <lb />
							England Parrents, But did not feel any Concern for my salvation <lb />
							being very wild till in my 10 year the thought once struck my <lb />
							mind, if I went on as I did I should not be sav&apos; d this Could <lb />
							me Home uneasiness for a time, but <add place="above">soon</add> vanishd in the delight <lb />
							I took in my vain pleasures, as I grew older I felt the depravity <lb />
							of my own nature, and the proponsity that lay in me to every <lb />
							evil which I had not power to withstand, notwithstanding the <lb />
							Convictions I felt to the Contrary, which I did my best to stifel <lb />
							as far as possible, My Mother Once took me aside, and <lb />
							with great Concem spoke very Closely to me about my bad <lb />
							Course telling me that the Lord saw every thing &amp; knew how <lb />
							I went on, taking me at the same time how I cou&apos;d be <lb />
							answerable for it when I shoud once appear before Him, <lb />
							this affected me for some time and I sought as well as I  <lb />
							cou&apos;d to amend my Life, that I might thereby merit the favour <lb />
							of God towards me, this lasted not long neither, before I <lb />
							was as bad as ever, My Parrents being recd into the Society <lb />
							my Mother often askd me to go with her to the MeetingsÂ  <lb />
							to which I had no inclination, &amp; therefore putt it off till in <lb />
							the year 1761 When my Mother was taken very Ill, the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> <lb />
							often visited her, by which means I got first a Love to them <lb />
							thinking there was something discernable in them I had never <lb />
							seen in any people before, from the time I went to hear them. <lb />
							and it was soon clear to me I belongd <add place="above">to</add> them, I soon made my <lb />
							desire known to be red into the Society, which was granted <lb />
							me 2 days before my Mothers departure, after my mother <lb />
							was gone I could no longer settle at home, but wanted to <lb />
							live with Sis<hi rend="superscript">trs</hi> my Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi> being of the Same mind with me <lb />
							She obtained leave to go to gumerfal Oeconomy, and a short <lb />
							time after I had leave to go to Holme Oeconomy, but not <lb />
							being Quite Settled in my self I was perswaded by my Father <lb />
							to return to him, during my stay with him, I had no Satisfaction <lb />
							wanting to go back, but coud not got directly leave, but

							rather an admonition which provd a real Blessing to me. <lb />
							I tund with my concern to our Saviour who prov&apos;d my freind <lb />
							My Father by means of a Conversation with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charlesworth <lb />
							which was at the Same time a Blessing to me also, inclind <lb />
							more willingly to let me go, &amp; in a short time I returnd to <lb />
							the Same Oeconomy, after Some time spent not so agreably <lb />
							we Spoke our minds to Our Laboress concerning our situation <lb />
							after which we got Ellen Lee to live with us from the Choir <lb />
							House, with whom we soon after moved to little Moore, here <lb />
							I felt at times verry chearfull, Yet longd very much to <lb />
							experience, the full asurance of my Sins being forgiven me <lb />
							Which I knew I had never rightly felt, it was not long before <lb />
							I injoyd that grace for which I can&apos;t sufficiently thank <lb />
							and Praise <add place="above">my Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></add> July ye 17 1768 I was recd into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb />
							to my great Joy, and abasement and aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 19 the same year <lb />
							obtained leave to move to my d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Choir House, which rejoiced <lb />
							me very much, on account of my sickly state I went directly <lb />
							into the Sickroom where I spent most of my time, it has been <lb />
							indeed a School of grace to my heart Especialy, when our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
							had made one after the other fitt for his eternal Embraces, <lb />
							which prov&apos;d a matter both of Joy &amp; Pain to me, Joy on their <lb />
							account but Pain on my own, knowing he had not as yet ataind <lb />
							his full aim with me, by bringing me thro&apos; this Sickly Habit of <lb />
							Body, to rely Stedfastly on him the true Physician, I felt a <lb />
							longing Desire to become a participant of his Corpse &amp; Blood <lb />
							Sacramenttaly, it seemd long to me before I injoyd this grace <lb />
							but when I partook for the first time July 16 1769 I can never <lb />
							express what my poor heart injoy&apos;d, From that time I became  <lb />
							more Solidly aquainted with my own poverty, and unsinnerlikeness, <lb />
							but depriv;d my self of the there injoyment of the Sinners happiness <lb />
							thro reasoning &amp; striving to help my self, being unwilling to <lb />
							appear as I realy was, which since then has Causd me some <lb />
							painfull reflections, in Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 1770 I had a Severe Fitt of Sickness <lb />
							at which time Our Savr manifested himself to me, in such <lb />
							a Manner, that I cou&apos;d rejoice in him knowing that <lb />
							he was Mine, and that I Shou&apos;d remain his to all Eternity
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							tho&apos; unworthy of the Least of all his Mercies, <lb />
							thus far her own account 
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Our Saviour has in a very poculiar manner accomplishd his <lb />
							work, in Our happilly departed Sis<hi rend="superscript">tr</hi>. She was of a Close <lb />
							dissposition &amp; did not like to be a Sinner till our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
							thro various means overcame her, it causd both her &amp; <lb />
							her Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> much pain to perceive, that tho, she sufferd <lb />
							So much in her Body, yet <add place="above">she</add> had always a reservedness <lb />
							her sickness being of a peculiar Nature together with <lb />
							this Causd the Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> often perplextity, as well as made <lb />
							it very heavy to her, she was otherwise of a submissive <lb />
							Tempor &amp; thro her good behaviour gain&apos;d the Love of  <lb />
							her Sist<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> during her abode in the Sickroom where <lb />
							She spent 2 whole years. About 4 months ago her <lb />
							disorder terminated in a Consumption and Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
							according to his bountifull dealings gave her that  <lb />
							inexpressible grace, that she got a clearness with Him, <lb />
							and know on whom she beloved <add place="above">that all</add> Her fears &amp; apprehensions <lb />
							about leaveing her Body &amp; the aproach of Eternity Vanished <lb />
							in the happy expectation, of seeing her wounded friend, <lb />
							often repeating her longing desire that he might come soon <lb />
							Our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> granted her in her latter days a real Sabatical <lb />
							injoyment of his Merits &amp; tho her Cough was troublesome <lb />
							to her, she had not much pain, Continuing to Look <lb />
							out for that happy Moment which came to her <lb />
							great Joy <del>on the 19 of Febry</del> about 10 in the forenoon <lb />
							when she departed happily <lb />
							with the Blessing of her Choir
