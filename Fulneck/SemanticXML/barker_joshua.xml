						and one at Mans Estate and of the 5 survising ones, one Son is a member of <lb/>
						our Society, he liv'd happily with his Wife and being of
						a religious turn he went <lb/>
						with his Wife constantly to the <placeName>Church</placeName> &amp; <name event="sacrament">Sacrament</name>, and had religious Meet-  <lb/>
						ings kept in his
						house where they us'd to pray and read <title>Burkets Exposition</title> on <lb/>
						the <name type="religious">new Testament</name>; his self working was for some time in his way,
						so that to <lb/>
						be a poor Sinner at the feet of <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> was a hard matter to him for some time, <lb/>
						and he was a long time among the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> before he got a feeling of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Dying <lb/>
						Love in his heart.
						When <persName ref="#mlper000536">Mr Ingham</persName> preach'd in the Beginning in these parts <lb/>
						he went to hear him, his Wife at first was against it; but upon her hearing <lb/>

						Land Lords being against the Preaching at his
						house, he rather left it than com- <lb/>
						ply with his Desire not to let the <name type="religious">Gospel</name> be preach'd there. He soon became <lb/>
						a Member of our
						<orgName>Society</orgName>, and had the Grace to be <name event="reception">receiv'd</name> on the <date when-iso="1752-04-22">22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of April  <lb/>
							
							1752</date> into the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> &amp; <date when-iso="1752-11-19">Nov. 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in the
								same year</date> he partook of the highest Good in <lb/>
						the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacrament</name> for the first time. Within these 2 Years he has occasionally <lb/>
						said to
						his Wife I shall not be long here but shall soon be go home, but don't be trou- <lb/>
						bled for you will not stay long after me. At the regulating of the Bands and Classes <lb/>
						anew in
						<date when-iso="1760-01">January 1760</date> he became a <name office="bond_servant">Bond Servant</name>, in which capacity he was a <lb/>
						faithfull Helper &amp; belov'd by

						On <date when-iso="1760-11-10">Monday night the 10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							of November</date> he was taken with a <name health="disease">violent and pain- <lb/>

						by <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Watson</persName> on his

						<roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>n</roleName> to bear him on their hearts, before Him
						on that account. From his first <lb/>
						becoming sick he always thought he <lb/> should yet Permission to leave his mor- <lb/>

						frequently rejoic'd in his heart, &amp; speaking with a Brother of the great Long- <lb/>

						with him I will speak a good Word for you, that he may soon fetch you also <lb/>
						and I'm sure he will
						not deny me my Request and this he comforted her about <lb/>
						their parting. Soon after the <name event="sacrament">Sacrament</name>, being visited by a B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
						he express'd <lb/>
						his great Longing for that highest Good, in order to strengthen his heart under <lb/>

						of <lb/>
						the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>
						<persName>Jesus</persName> was what his heart rely'd upon and his its only Good for time &amp; <lb/>
						Eternity. Once being visited he express'd his Desire to be buried with
						his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> <lb/>
						at <placeName>Lambs Hill</placeName> and seemed grieved that on account of his outward Circumstances <lb/>
						he must give up that
						hope but he was soon comforted upon our assuring <lb/>
						him we wou'd see to it that his desire shou'd be accomplish'd. <date when-iso="1761-01-21">Jan 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi></date> he had <lb/>

						<name type="holiday">Great Sabbath</name>
						<persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Watson</persName> carried him the <name event="sacrament">Sacram<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></name>, and first related <add place="above">to him</add> what <lb/>
						<del>had</del> had pass'd in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> at <placeName>G.H</placeName>. on Maunday Thursday and then <add place="above">in a</add> child- <lb/>
						like <del>Prayer</del> Prayer beg'd that mouth which

						of his Deaths Agony &amp; take him home to himself or soon
						enable him to appear <lb/>
						again among his <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>. Then he sung: What <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> thee so tormented &amp;c.
						O let him in <lb/> thy nail holes see his Pardon &amp; Election free &amp;c. Give him absolution, and a gen- <lb/>

						during an <lb/>
						inexpressible tender &amp; melting feeling he receiv'd his share of the <name event="sacrament">holy Sacram<hi rend="superscript">t</hi></name> <lb/>
						after which he
						was particularly chearfull and happy and frequently said to his <lb/>
						Wife, now I have got what I wanted, and seem'd highly blessed. That Night <lb/>
