					<p> was a very industrious &amp; loving Helpmate <lb/> to her Husband, She went on in a still
						course, <lb/> and was of a few words, and loved our <lb/>Saviour and his
						people. She gave up her <lb/> room with chearfulness to the Married choir,
						<lb/> particularly on Sundays, for them to sit <lb/> and keep their Bands,
						she was of a very <lb/>
						<del>Healthy</del> Healthy constitution, and did not <lb/> know what
						sickness was, till within half <lb/> a year past, when her strength began to
						<lb/> fail, &amp; felt much pain in her Tabernacle <lb/> She then said and
						believed that this would <lb/> prove the means of her Dissolution, to which
						<lb/> she was Resign&apos;d &amp; said that she might go <lb/> Home to her
						dear Saviour, she was however <lb/> willing to use any means which were
						<lb/> recommended, to her, but all was without <lb/> Effect, at last she was
						obliged to take to <lb/> her Bed, which she has kept above 3 months <lb/>and
						endured often much pain, having <lb/> lost the use of most of her Limbs, her
						<lb/> prayer to our Saviour was Constantly, <lb/> that He might give her
						patience to hold <lb/> out till he Should think fit to release her, <lb/>
						which was in a particular manner granted <lb/> to her, for she bore every
						thing very patiently </p>
					<cb />
					<p> she was often concern&apos;d for her poor Husband, <lb/> who allone was able to Lift &amp;
						Nurse her by <lb/> day and night, least it should be to hard <lb/> for Him,
						she partook with her Husband <lb/> 3 times of the holy Comunion on her <lb/>
						Sickbed, She was beloved by her Brethren <lb/> &amp; sisters, &amp;
						neighbours as a child of God, <lb/> she spocke and was sensible allmost to
						<lb/> her End, a few minutes before her depart- <lb/> ure she said: Lord
						Jesus help me, <lb/> a Liturgy was kept her, during which <lb/> the near
						presence of our Lord was Sweetly <lb/> felt, she then received the Blessing
						of her <lb/> Husband and Cong<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and fell quite
						<lb/> easy &amp; softly asleep in the 67 year <lb/> of her Age </p>
