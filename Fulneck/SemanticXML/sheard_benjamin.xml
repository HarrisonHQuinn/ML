							The Life of B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Benjamin Sheard<lb/>
							who has wrote the following of him self
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						I was born it Littletown in the Parish of Birstal <lb/>
						Novr 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1715 my Parents beeing Presbeterians, <lb/>
						I was Baptised, &amp; brought up in the Same Religion <lb/>
						when I was about 16 Years of Age my Corruption <lb/>
						got the mastery over me, and let me in to all manner <lb/>
						of amusements as Singing &amp; Dancing and the <lb/>
						pleasures of this world, which I pursued with my <lb/>
						Whole Heart for 3 Years, which was a great Grief <lb/>
						to my Parents, they admonishd me many times <lb/>
						to leave of this ways, but all was to no purpose <lb/>
						for I found I could not help my self. In April <lb/>
						1734 I was Married with my wife at Birstal <lb/>
						Church. In 1738 I had Some Conversation <lb/>
						with a man who told me how he had been awaken <lb/>
						end, and what Distress he had been in &amp; how <lb/>
						our Saviour had delivered him, he lent me <lb/>
						a Book to read, called the Young mans Guide <lb/>
						upon which I begun to read, &amp; to pray &amp; to reform <lb/>
						my Life, but the happy change did not last <lb/>
						long, but I fell soon in to my old course again <lb/>
						untill the Year 1739 when M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham begun <lb/>
						to preach and Settled Societys I went to hear <lb/>
						him, but I felt such a Condemnation in my heart, <lb/>
						thinking my day of Grace was past &amp; that there <lb/>
						was no mercy for me, In this situation I remained <lb/>
						for Some time, but at last our Saviour gave <lb/>
						<note type="catchword">me</note>

						me a Gracious Look and Refreshed my poor heart <lb/>
						In this happy feeling I went on for Some time, I got  <lb/>
						more &amp; more acquainted with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> which proved <lb/>
						a great Blessing to my heart, but when I began to <lb/>
						think well of my self I lost that happy feeling and <lb/>
						became dry in my heart, but my dear Saviour <lb/>
						Shewed me my deviation and I crept to Him <lb/>
						as a Sinner, March 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1750 I and my wife <lb/>
						had the Grace &amp; favour to be Received in to the  <lb/>
						Congregation at Fulneck, which was a real <lb/>
						Blessing for my poor heart, there I felt that <lb/>
						our dear Saviour watched in the midst of <lb/>
						His Congregation, and that I was one of His  <lb/>
						Family, Some times I wept on account of <lb/>
						my faults &amp; wants and Some times my <lb/>
						heart near melted with mercy &amp; forgiveness. <lb/>
						In our married state our Saviour has <lb/>
						Blesed us with 12 children 6 sons &amp; <lb/>
						6 Daughters, all are gone before me <lb/>
						Except 2 daughters who are under the <lb/>
						Care of the Congregation, with my wife I  <lb/>
						have lived happy and agreeable. 
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						So far his own writings.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						He partook of the Lords Supper the first time <lb/>
						with the Congr<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Sept 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1750. He became <lb/>
						an Acoluth of the Brethrens church in August <lb/>
							1767, and he was one of our Comittee Brethren
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
						He was much beloved by his Brn &amp; Sisters <lb/>
						and by his Neighboors as a Man of God <lb/>
						he had a tender heart to our dear Saviour <lb/>
						and took, share in the weal &amp; was <lb/>
						of the Congregation. And he was Little <lb/>
							&amp; mean in his own Eyes.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						he has been troubled with an Asthmatich <lb/>
						Disorder for Several Years, which he bore <lb/>
						with great patience He was however able <lb/>
						to follow his Bussness, &amp; come to the chapel <lb/>
						till a few weeks before his End, he was <lb/>
						chearfully Resignd to his dear Savr <lb/>
						on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Septr Br Hauptman <lb/>
						had a very chearful &amp; loving Conversation <lb/>
						with him about being ready, &amp; without <lb/>
						fear when our dear Lord calls one <lb/>
							but no one did think that his End was
							So near, for on the 7<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in the afternoon <lb/>
						he got permission to leave his mortal <lb/>
							Tent in the 59<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year of his age.
