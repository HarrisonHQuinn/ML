            <p>
                
                    Our S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beterous Atkinson was born <lb />
                    May the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1742 at Wike in Birstal Parish. Tho' <lb />
                    she was still baptised in the Church of England, yet as <lb />
                    her Parents belong'd to the Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> from the time of the <lb />
                    first awakening in this Country, she from her <lb />
                    Childhood was in the Care of the Sisters. But <lb />
                    as nothing very particular of the Work of our <lb />
                    Lord was observed in her Heart, she in her 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Year <lb />
                    took some little offence, which ended in a Confusion <lb />
                    of Mind, and of Consequence a Coldness and Shyness <lb />
                    towards those, who sought the Prosperity of her Soul <lb />
                    <del>took place</del> which continued till she was married on <lb />
                    Sept. 21. 1766. The uneasiness of Heart which she was <lb />
                    never quite free from, become now serious, and this <lb />
                    was the Period of her Life, in which she was <lb />
                    actually awakened, and saw and felt that she had <lb />
                    never known our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, as a Sinner. She <lb />
                    now sought again for Fellowship with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb />
                    and in Dec. 1769 she was readmitted into the Society, <lb />
                    and after repeated Supplications she was recieved <lb />
                    into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> April 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>. 1770. She was now at times <lb />
                    very chearful and increased in the Knowledge of <lb />
                    herself. Last winter she fell into a lingering state <lb />
                    of Health, and this no Pains were spared towards <lb />
                    her Recovery, yet it was all in Vain, and a regular 
                
            </p>

                <div type="page" n="2">

            <p>
                    consumptive Disorder took Place. As she had <lb />
                    entertain'd great Hopes of overcoming this Sickness, <lb />
                    she was so much the more disappointed when she <lb />
                    was insured of the Contrary, and a certain Fear <lb />
                    of Death siezed her, which made her at first very <lb />
                    heavy; But she pray'd our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> so long, till <lb />
                    he was graciously pleased to remove this from <lb />
                    her. From thence ensued a settled Hearts Desire <lb />
                    and longing to be with him the sooner the better, <lb />
                    and she grew so remarkably in the inner Con, that <lb />
                    it was a Pleasure to behold it. She had a great <lb />
                    desire to enjoy the h. Sacrament <add place="above">while</add> here, which she <lb />
                    also obtained June 24<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> and the Days following <lb />
                    she was inexpressibly Happy in her Heart, and <lb />
                    thus she kept growing in our Lord Grace and <lb />
                    longing after his coming till the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of July <lb />
                    when a few Moments before her Soul took <lb />
                    flight she still said: Sweet Jesus! Her dying <lb />
                    life lasted 29 years and 2 months.
