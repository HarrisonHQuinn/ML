               <p>The course of Life of <rs ref="mlper000219" cert="high">Abigal Bently</rs> I was born at <rs cert="high">Wike in the Parish of Barstel</rs> <date when-iso="1722-05-23">April y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1722</date> my Parrents was of the <orgName>Church of England</orgName> and brought me up in the same, as far as I can
                  remember my first thought of being fared was thro' hereing my  speak with another what time Children begun to be anserable for Sin and they thought at
                  Seven-years, this had such an impression on my mind that I often went alone and wish'd <persName type="deity">God</persName> wou'd let me die before that time for then I took it for
                  granted I should be saved, <date when-iso="1729" cert="medium">when I was about Seven Years</date> I began to be <name>afraid</name> of dying, my Parrents strove to
                  preserve me as far as there circumstances permitted them, <date when-iso="1733">in my Eleventh year</date> I was sent to live with a Neighbour where I heard and saw all sorts of bad
                  things had not our dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had a perticular Hand over me I should have been ruined in Soul and Body, when I was there they sent me into a
                  Feild to work where I was so cold that I had no feeling of Hands nor Fat nor could I come to any House, all on a sudden it came in my mind that <hi rend="superscript"><persName type="deity">God</persName></hi> could warm me and I grew directly warm this was the first time I <del>know</del> thot <persName type="deity">God</persName> could here us
                     <del>or know </del> or know any thing of us after some time I left this place and removed into a nother <del>place</del> that was more agreable, here I took much to reading and
                  intended to be very good, but amidst it all I ataind to no satisfaction but a constant condemnation follow'd me with every thing I did, so far her own <del>words</del>
                  <hi rend="superscript">writing</hi> about this time she began to hear <rs ref="mlper000536" cert="high">Mr Igham</rs> and when the societys of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>

                  <hi rend="superscript">a while</hi> but her being of a very League turn made it very <hi rend="superscript">heavy</hi> for her amidst of the <orgName>Sisters</orgName></p>

                     <roleName en="honorific">Sisters</roleName> who' was under the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> care which she took very much to heart and could hardly be

                  she was in her heart very dry and her being so very self righteous <del>was</del> made it very heavy for her to fell as a Sinner depart alone upon our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> and this has been ameans of her course being some what heavy in the Congregation, and so she continued removeing for some time from place to place to place by
                  the direction of the <orgName>B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> when at last she got leave to go and live with some <orgName>Sisters</orgName> at the Home where she

                  as she was once coming from a meeting this verse was perticularly aplyd to her Heart, Out of pure grace unmerited, Salvation show'rs on our Head Merely because the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> had dy'd, Because a Lamb was Crucify'd, Are we invited to possess a Throne, Before the World was made ordaind our own, and she was from this time

                  <del>Mortimer</del> to remove with them to that in <rs cert="high">Pudsey</rs>, but here it she did not spend her time so <name>chearfully</name> as could have been

               <p>for she lost many happy hours for her own heart thro' looking so much at others and being so very strict with her self she could not easily look over things that some times accord
                  amongst her compan -ions, yet at the same time we cannot denigh but as to her true Heart to her Choir and the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> we was fully persuaded which show'd it
                  self evedintly on various occasions, <date when-iso="1754">in the year 1754</date>

                  entirely broken up, and so she with the rest of her <orgName>Sisters</orgName> came here into this House where she continued very <name>chearfull</name> for some time
                  and cou'd not express her self enough of the joy She felt that she was now got to her right home, but thro' her very strict way of thinking she brought her self into <del>many</del>
