							Mary Alott <lb />
							Was born at Barksland in the Parish of <lb />
							Elland. On the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Dec<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1734 N S. 
						</p>
					<p>
							When she was about Three years old her <lb />
							Father dyed &amp; she liv&apos;d with her Mother &amp; <lb />
							her Aunt (Namely Betty Midgley) who <lb />
							jointly Nurs&apos;d &amp; Maintain&apos;d <add place="above">her</add> till she was <lb />
							about seven, then her Mother being again <lb />
							Married her Aunt left them took a Room <lb />
							&amp; design&apos;d to live by herself, But <add place="above">Mary</add> not being <lb />
							at all willing to be left behind often begg&apos;d  <lb />
							her Aunt to take her with her, which  <lb />
							according<add place="above">ly</add> in a few weeks after she Willlingly <lb />
							did, &amp; Cared for her as her own. 
						</p>
					<p>
							When she was about Nine years old she <lb />
							by the Drawing of the Holy Ghost was inclin&apos;d <lb />
							to hear the Gospel which she of her own free <lb />
							accord begun &amp; Continued Constantly to do. 
						</p>
					<p>
							Some time after her Aunt had a mind for <lb />
							the more Convenince of hearing the Brn <lb />
							to live nearer Smith House &amp; she made it <lb />
							out with the Brethren that Mary should also <lb />
							come &amp; remain with her which she was very 
							glad off. <lb />
						</p>
					<p>
							In July 1748 they Both of them together got <lb />
							leave to live with the Single Sisters in Clack- <lb />
							Heaton &amp; she remain&apos;d there &amp; in the same <lb />
							Oconomy at Tyre-sell-Hall till we came <lb />
							in the Choir House (Which I shall take 
							Notice of afterwards) <lb />
						</p>
					<p>
							In the year 1751 on the 5<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of April she <lb />
							was receiv&apos;d in the Congregation which Pleas&apos;d  
							<note type="catchword">her</note>

							her very much. In 1753 on the 25 of February <lb />
							she after many a Hearty wish &amp; Earnest longing <lb />
							for it was addmitted to the Lords Supper <lb />
							In the same year was Receiv&apos;d from the Great Girls <lb />
							to the Single Sisters Choir. 
						</p>
					<p>
							She has since about 10, or 11, Years Old, <lb />
							carried about a Very Sickly &amp; Weakly Tabernacle <lb />
							which she bore without Complaint, &amp; being of an  <lb />
							exceeding still quiet, but also very solid &amp; <lb />
							sensible <del>Dispossition</del> Disposition she was seldom <lb />
							heard to speak about any thing except when <lb />
							spoken to: But however as we now have found she <lb />
							took good Notice of ever thing &amp; Ponderd them in  <lb />
							her Heart. 
						</p>
					<p>
							In February this present year she had the <lb />
							Small-Pox which not only went very hardly <lb />
							with her But also left that remaining on her <lb />
							which Render&apos;d her Much more Weak &amp; Sickly <lb />
							than before a Consumption appearing thro&apos; her <lb />
							Whole Constitution: It was manifest to all about her <lb />
							she could not hold it out long, tho she herself wod <lb />
							commonly say when ask&apos;d about it &quot;that she was <lb />
							pretty well. Nevertheless what she inwardly felt <lb />
							Brought her <add place="above">also</add> upon the thoughts &amp; consideration  <lb />
							of going to Our Saviour (as she afterward, de- <lb />
							clar&apos;d with Joy.) 
						</p>
					<p>
							In July she was a little Better but the disor- <lb />
							der Presently return&apos;d more strong than ever: <lb />
							Yet she continued to walk about till the 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> of <lb />
							November, then she entirely took her to her <lb />
							Room &amp; soon after to her Bed. 
						</p>
					<p>
							Now she freely acknowledgeing that she <lb />
							had all this summer last, been in a Continual <lb />
							meditation &amp; Consultation with her Dear Saviour 
							<note type="catchword">about</note> 
						
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						
							about her going to him, having <add place="above">all</add> along been Senscible <lb />
							of it for herself that she should not stay here <lb />
							but the Reason why she would not confess it <lb />
							openly was because she was affraid she should <lb />
							not go as soon as she wish&apos;d for. 
						</p>
					<p>
							She was now exceeding Bad, but quite Brisk <lb />
							in <add place="above">her</add> Spirits &amp; chearful in Heart &amp; Soul, &amp; as before <lb />
							even Ever since we have known her she has <lb />
							been us&apos;d to speak very little, so Now to the Con- <lb />
							trary, <add place="above">she</add> spoke a great deal especialy to these <lb />
							with whom she had had an intimiate acquaintance <lb />
							&amp; Perticularly with Our dear Sister Mary <lb />
							who very faithfully visited her all the time 
						</p>
					<p>
							On the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant she had her Birth-Day <lb />
							(being 20; years old,) when many Sisters who vis- <lb />
							ited her Express&apos;d their Hearty wishes for her <lb />
							which she receiv&apos;d, &amp; answer&apos;d with much satis- <lb />
							faction: In the afternoon her Class made <lb />
							her a Very Pretty Love-Feast which rejoice- <lb />
							ed her Exceedingly &amp; in which she spoke of <lb />
							her Departure with such Pleasure &amp; Delight <lb />
							as she never had done before; she spoke with <lb />
							sister Mary &amp; Made out Ev&apos;ry thing that was in  <lb />
							her Mind about her Burial, as well as all <lb />
							the Hearty wishes &amp; desires of her heart for <lb />
							her Class &amp; c. In short she said that this had <lb />
							been to her the Happiest day she ever had <lb />
							had in all her life. This day &amp; forward she  <lb />
							unbosom&apos;d &amp; declar&apos;d what she had (Perhaps) <lb />
							kept Treasur&apos;d up in her Heart to this Opper- <lb />
							tunity for some years Past, She spoke of her  <lb />
							various Troubles &amp; Anxieties in Particular Circum 
							<note type="catchword">-stances</note>

							Circumstances, such as no body had perciev&apos;d on her <lb />
							with a Chearful &amp; Thankful Heart, being <lb />
							bowed with Shame before him will whom she <lb />
							had spent many happy Moments, days &amp; years 
						</p>
					<p>
							About the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it being Two years since <lb />
							we came in <add place="above">our</add> Choir House she told Sister Mary <lb />
							Ev&apos;rything how she had been &amp; was in Tyre- <lb />
							sell-Hall at that time, What Anxiety &amp; <lb />
							Concern she felt about coming in the Choir House <lb />
							fearing Least she should not have leave to  <lb />
							come &amp; how she had in Shillness Pray&apos;d &amp; wept <lb />
							before her dear Lamb, that he would give <lb />
							her Leave to come &amp; that if she should have  <lb />
							that favour that he would grant her the feel <lb />
							ing &amp; nearness of his Wounds that she might <lb />
							be faithful to him therein &amp;c. Nay his almost <lb />
							incredible, how quick &amp; active her Memory <lb />
							was over this matter she not only gave Sisr <lb />
							Mary an account of herself but of all the  <lb />
							Sisters in Tyre-sell-Hall at that time, she  <lb />
							(unperceiv&apos;d) had taken Notice of ev&apos;ry One, <lb />
							conduct words &amp; behaviour, But to return <lb />
							she also Express&apos;d herself in a very Lively <lb />
							manner with grace &amp; Understanding <hi rend="underline">how</hi> <lb />
							Exceedingly she was Rejoiced when she was <lb />
							assured she should come here. She at the  <lb />
							same time viz&apos; the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> or 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Instant spoke w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
							with an inly Tender feeling about the Choir <lb />
							&amp; Choir Grace what she has felt since <lb />
							she was Receiv&apos;d in the Single Sisters Choir <lb />
							&amp; what her dear Bridegroom has done from <lb />
							time to time on her therein, &amp; Perticularly <lb />
							in this Present Year, together with the Esteem 
							<note type="&amp;" /> 
						
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						
							&amp; Satisfaction she has had for, &amp; in the Choir House <lb />
							this she did from time to time Repeat And <lb />
							also she would allways take notice of many <lb />
							Sisters whom she saw &amp; Reflected on their <lb />
							Situation at Present and time Pass &amp; when <lb />
							Sister Mary came to her then she would sell <lb />
							her all her Mind about them &amp; Especialy the <lb />
							concern she had had, about her Class under <lb />
							some heavy Circumstances some Months agoe <lb />
							&amp; being ask&apos;d why she did not speak at such <lb />
							time what she had in her mind? She answer&apos;d <lb />
							&quot;that she always thought herself too mean <lb />
							&amp; too insignificant to Speak Her mind about <lb />
							any thing, But she had instead of that gone <lb />
							somewhere in a Corner &amp; Wept for them be <lb />
							fore her dear Saviour &amp; Pray&apos;d him that he <lb />
							would Bless Preserve &amp; keep them &amp; Her <lb />
							&amp; that they Might all become a Joy to Him 
						</p>
					<p>
							Once in Sister Mary&apos;s Presence after having <lb />
							fully spoken &amp; Open&apos;d all her Mind to her a <lb />
							bout Many things, she took Notice that her <lb />
							Aunt (who faithfuly tended &amp; Nurs&apos;d <lb />
							her all the time of Sickness) was a Cry- <lb />
							ing: So she demanded the Reason of her why <lb />
							she wept, telling her she had no Ocassion <lb />
							to weep for her since &quot;says she&quot; I am fully <lb />
							Satisfied &amp; Reconciled both with My Lamb &amp; <lb />
							&amp; with all my Sisters &amp; have spoke my mind  <lb />
							about Everything &amp; Now am Ready to go  <lb />
							whenever he Pleases
						</p>
					<p>
							Thus she Continued under a Deep Sense <lb />
							&amp; Speaking of herself &amp; her Choir &amp; Often <lb />
							Expressing her Desire to go. But yet she <lb />

							would Secretly sometimes say to her Aunt that <lb />
							she believ&apos;d she should live till Christmas, but <lb />
							If our Saviour Pleasd to take her before, she <lb />
							would be glad 
						</p>
					<p>
							Sunday Last about 11 or 12 in the Evening <lb />
							she was Siez&apos;d with the monst Violent pain <lb />
							So that Sister Mary who at the same time <lb />
							watch&apos;d with her Perceiv&apos;d such a Senscible <lb />
							Alteration not only by her Excessive Pains <lb />
							but also by the Motion &amp; Alteration of all <lb />
							her Faculties that she thought she Realy would  <lb />
							go, &amp; thereupon ask&apos;d her if she was now quite <lb />
							Ready. She with Pleasure &amp; Serenity answerd <lb />
							&quot;yes! I am Quite Ready now &amp; shall be glad to <lb />
							go to my Lamb as soon as he Pleases. 
						</p>
					<p>
							However she reviv&apos;d a little &amp; then desired <lb />
							2 verses which she named to be sung for her <lb />
							viz Appear as her Protector who turns to <lb />
							Joy all Tears &amp; When she shall get Per- <lb />
							mission to leave this Mortal Tent, From Pains <lb />
							&amp; Griefs Dissmission Thy self Just then present <lb />
							And then says she &quot;Sing Hush stir not up <lb />
							the friend of Christ, Wake not the lovely <lb />
							Bride &amp;c 
						</p>
					<p>
							She was very Bad all Night &amp; Lay like <lb />
							one Expireing till towards Night on Monday <lb />
							Yet she Bore her Pains with Much more <lb />
							Patience <add place="above">than</add> any one could Expect who did but <lb />
							<hi rend="underline">see</hi> how she was Munday night she was some- <lb />
							waht Easier &amp; appear&apos;d to ys as if she might <lb />
							Possibly continue a few days, But if she heard <lb />
							any one take notice of the near approach  <lb />
							<note type="catchword">of</note> 
						
					</p>
					<pb />
					<p>
						
							of <lb />
							Christmass &amp; of the Joy we Expected in the Birth- <lb />

							them that if our Saviour only was Pleas&apos;d to let <lb />
							her go to him before or in the Holidays She <lb />
							should have a far Better Christmass than  <lb />
							We and that she would be glad of.
						</p>
					<p>
							Tusday Night she Alter&apos;d again &amp; on Wed- <lb />
							nesday Morning was much Worse. In the <lb />
							Forenoon we thought again she would Certain- <lb />
							ly Depart, But she continued and lay severly <lb />
							Oppresse&apos;d with the Most Excessive Pangs thro&apos; <lb />
							Ev&apos;ry Limb &amp; Fibre, Speaking very little, But <lb />
							Panting in Stillness for the Happy Moment <lb />
							when she should get the Departing Kiss, And  <lb />
							when Sometimes her Tabernacle seem&apos;d to be <lb />
							almost Rack&apos;d in Pieces with the most shock- <lb />

							was the Only One Great Girl in all the  <lb />
							Oconomies was One of the first that was <lb />
							Receiv&apos;d in the Congregation The Only One <lb />
							that came in the Choir House at first <lb />
							She was the first that was admitted to the <lb />
							Sacrament. And Now the first that is gone <lb />
							to Our saviour. Where she Rests from all her <lb />
							Pain: And has Left behind her the Char- <lb />
							acter of an Honest Upright Unaffected <lb />
							&amp; Enamour&apos;d Virgin Heart She has been <lb />
							Known by those who have liv&apos;d with her from <lb />
							her first Commg <add place="above">among us</add> to this Her Dissalution to be <lb />
							an Example of Patience of Steadfastness &amp; <lb />
							Constancy in her Love to him who first gave <lb />
							her Confidence to believe in his Wounds she <lb />
							never Once having been Perceiv&apos;d to Draw back <lb />
							or to Slight her Calling in Joy or in Smart, <lb />
							and Now at last her Mouth has made <del>a</del> <lb />
							a Brief Confession of Him Whom her Heart <lb />
							has Loved Felt &amp; Believ&apos;d on.
