							Life</hi></p>
					<p> I was born at <placeName>Frestrup</placeName> in the <placeName>Parish of
							Pembrokshire</placeName>
						<date when-iso="1741-02-06">Febr 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							<lb/> 1741</date>, &amp; lived with my Parents till <date
							when-iso="1748" cert="medium">I was 7 years of Age</date>; about this
						<lb/> time <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript"
									>r</hi></roleName> Cennick</persName> came into this Country
						&amp; Preached the Gospel, <lb/> my Mother who went frequently to hear him,
						took me with her <lb/> which I liked. When a <name event="religious"
							>Childrens Meeting</name> was begun, I had the <lb/> Grace to be one of
						them who attended it, which proved a <name type="emotion">blessing <lb/> to
							me</name>, for there I got the first Impression of our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Love. </p>
					<p>
						<persName><roleName type="honorific">Esq<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></roleName> Roach</persName> of
							<placeName>Clarison</placeName> being a lover of the Gospel &amp; a
						friend <lb/> of Children he settled a School, to which I also was taken, but
						I <lb/> having no Genius for learning, did not bring it far, yet by frequent
						<lb/> hearing the Versses out of the little Hymn Book which he had bought
						<lb/> for the Children, I learned many of them by heart &amp; <name
							type="emotion">delighted in <lb/> singing them</name>. Our Master who
						was a very good Man, used to sing <lb/> Verses before &amp; after Meals of
						which the following made a particular <lb/> Impression upon me: We thank the
							<roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for this our Food; but more
						<lb/> for <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> Flesh &amp; Blood the
						Manna to the Spirit giv&apos;n the living Bread <lb/> sent down from
							<placeName type="biblical">Heav&apos;n</placeName>. At Nights our Master
						used to kneel <lb/> down with us, &amp; oftens pray&apos;d very heartily
						that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
							>r</hi></roleName> might <lb/> preserve us from every bad thing &amp;
						lead us in the way to everlasting <lb/> Life. We Children kept also Meetings
						among ourselves &amp; when we <lb/> went into the Fields, we sometimes
						kneel&apos;d down under the Hedges &amp; <lb/> pray&apos;d to our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in a
						Childlike simple manner. When I was about <lb/>
						<date when-iso="1753" cert="medium">12 years of age</date> I went to <name

					<p> I get enough to eat. <date when-iso="1755" cert="medium">After 2 Years</date> I went to
						another place, where I <lb/> had it better in outward respects, but was much
						exposed to bad and <lb/> hurtful Company, so that I lost those good
						Impressions which I had <lb/> as a Child, &amp; a Desire for the World &amp;
						is Vanity took place in me. </p>
					<p> When <date when-iso="1760" cert="medium">I was about 19 Years old</date>,
						one of my former Masters wanted <lb/> me to enter again into his Service,
						with whom I also agreed, &amp; as <lb/> I learn&apos;d afterwards, a Scheme
						was laid, that if I had come there, <lb/> I very likely should have settled
						&amp; been entirely lost in the things of <lb/> this World; but before the
						time came quite on, I went to see my <lb/> Mother &amp; Sister, who
						persuaded me to go &amp; work as a <name occupation="mason">Mason</name> on
						the <lb/> Fortification, which was then to be build, tho&apos; I never had
						been em- <lb/> ploy&apos;d as a <name occupation="mason">Mason</name>
						before, but I got Tools &amp; went, &amp; the <roleName type="honorific"
							>Lord</roleName> to <lb/> whom I pray&apos;d, helped me, so that I could
						go on with the work &amp; there- <lb/> by all Dangers, which awaited me, if
						I had gone again to Service, <lb/> were prevented. Living now with my
						Mother, she asked me to go with <lb/> her to <name event="religious">divine
							Service</name>, which I did, as I had no particular Choise in <lb/> this
						Respect. After I had been to hear <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi
									rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Nyberg</persName> several
						times he spoke <lb/> to me &amp; invited me to call &amp; see him, which I
						did the Sunday after, when <lb/> we had had some Conversation together, he
						told me, that now the <lb/>
						<orgName>Society</orgName> would have a meeting &amp; I might be present; As
						soon as I <lb/> entered the Room, I was seized with <name type="emotion">an
							holy awe</name> &amp; the praying <lb/> of the Litany in that Meeting
						made such an Impression upon me <lb/> that I not only looked upon them as
						true Children of <persName type="deity">God</persName>, but became <lb/>
						also seriously concerned about myself. I then went to the <name
							event="religious">Meeting</name>

					<p> every Sunday &amp; in my return, I oftens pray&apos; d to our <roleName type="honorific"
								>Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to <lb/>
						<name type="emotion">make me happy &amp; give me the assurance thereof in my
							heart</name>. <lb/> I had still some Difficulties on account of my
						former Connexions, <lb/> but my faithfull <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> help&apos;d me thro&apos; &amp;
						made me free from them all. <lb/> As we lived about 3 Miles distant from
							<placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName>, &amp; my <lb/> Mother was not so
						well cared for as I could wish, I took a House <lb/> &amp; moved with her to
							<placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName> where we lived happily toge- <lb/>
						ther. <date when-iso="1765-05-12">May the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							1765</date> I was <name event="reception">received</name> into the
							<orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>
						which I <lb/> esteemed very highly. In general <name type="emotion">I have
							had a very happy time</name>
						<lb/> &amp; had many a Visit from our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in the Converse with him; As
						well <lb/> in my Sleeping place, as when I took a walk in the Fields &amp;
						once <lb/> in particular when I walked by the River Side, He appeared to my
						poor <lb/> heart &amp; assured me that I should be His &amp; that he has
						shed his Blood for <lb/> all my Sins; <date when-iso="1768-03-31">March
								31<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1768</date> I was made a partaker
						of our <roleName type="honorific">Lords</roleName>
						<lb/> Flesh &amp; Blood in the <name event="sacrament">holy
						Sacrament</name>, Ah! how thankful am I <lb/> for all the Grace our
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						has bestow&apos;d upon me, how often has He drawn <lb/> so near to me, that
						I have melted into Tears, when I have been praying <lb/> or speaking to him,
						these were happy Times, which I shall never forget.</p>
					<p>Thus far his own words.</p>
					<p> When <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
							Petrus</persName> was in <placeName>Haverforthwest</placeName>, he
						desired &amp; obtained leave <lb/> to come to <placeName ref="mlpla000003"
							>Fulneck</placeName> &amp; arrived here <date when-iso="1768-08-28"
							>Augst 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1768</date>. His course here has
						<lb/> been Edifying &amp; to our Satisfaction, he always expressed a great
						<lb/> Regard for the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi rend="superscript"
								>n</hi></orgName>, but when he saw or heard any thing unbecoming
						<lb/> in any one, who lived in the <orgName en="congregation">Cong<hi
								rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName>, he did not rightly know how to
						<lb/> take it, yet our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript"
								>r</hi></roleName> always reminded him to look to himself &amp; </p>

					<p> to dwell upon the faults of others &amp; thereby farther hurt was <lb/> prevented. He
						oftens expressed a Desire to serve our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi
								rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, &amp; some <lb/> time before
						his <name health="disease">last Sickness</name> begun; he declared to his
						Labourer: <lb/> That he had devoted himself quite a new to our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> &amp; his
						People, <lb/> was quite satisfied as &amp; where he was at present, but if
						our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>
						<lb/> would give him a Call to any other place or employ, if he but <lb/>
						knew, it came from Him, he would accept of it with all <lb/> his heart.
							<date when-iso="1771-12">Last December</date>
						<name health="disease" type="cold">he got a bad Cold</name>, which turned
						<lb/> to a <name health="disease" type="fever">severe Cough attended with a
							Hectic Fever</name>. He expressed <lb/> a Desire to go to our <roleName
							type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>, but said,
						that he was not clear, if <lb/> it would be now. The Medicine he took had
						but little affect <lb/> yet we thought, the warm wheather &amp; some gentle
						Exercise <lb/> might perhaps be a means of his recovery, &amp; when it was
						prac- <lb/> ticed, it seemed to have a good effect, so that about 3 weeks
						ago <lb/> he thought still, that he would be able to take a Journey to
							<placeName>Wales</placeName>
						<lb/> &amp; fixed the day for his setting out, which proved to be the day of
						<lb/> his happy Departure. Eight Days ago his Sickness took a turn, <lb/>
						when it appeared, that his time here would be but short, &amp; when <lb/>
						the <name occupation="doctor" memoirSubject="no">Doctor</name> told him so,
						he was exceeding glad of it &amp; waited with <lb/> resignation for his
						Desolution; a little before his Departure, a <lb/>
						<roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> said to
						him: that now he would soon be with our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Savr</roleName> and appear <lb/> before him in his Blood &amp;
						Righteousness, upon which he answered <lb/> Ah! that is pretty, if I had no
							<roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>,
						what should I do now? In this <lb/> Comfortable Disposition &amp; with a
						Reconciled heart he went to his <roleName type="honorific"
							>Redeemer</roleName>
						<lb/> in the <date when-iso="1772" cert="medium" type="death">31<hi
