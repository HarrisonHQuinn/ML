					<p> I was born at <placeName ref="mlpla000200" cert="high">Frestrup in the Parish of Pembrokshire</placeName>
						<date when-iso="1741-02-06">Febr 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi>
							<lb/> 1741</date>, &amp; lived with my Parents till <date when-iso="1748" cert="medium">I was 7 years of Age</date>; about this
						<lb/> time <persName ref="mlper000408"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Cennick</persName> came into this Country
						&amp; Preached the Gospel, <lb/> my Mother who went frequently to hear him,
						took me with her <lb/> which I liked. When a <name event="ecclesiastical">Childrens Meeting</name> was begun, I had the <lb/> Grace to be one of
						them who attended it, which proved a <name type="emotion">blessing <lb/> to
							me</name>, for there I got the first Impression of our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi></roleName> Love. </p>
					<p>
						<persName><roleName type="honorific">Esq<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Roach</persName> of
							<placeName>Clarison</placeName> being a lover of the Gospel &amp; a
						friend <lb/> of Children he settled a School, to which I also was taken, but
						I <lb/> having no Genius for learning, did not bring it far, yet by frequent
						<lb/> hearing the Versses out of the little Hymn Book which he had bought
						<lb/> for the Children, I learned many of them by heart &amp; <name type="emotion">delighted in <lb/> singing them</name>. Our Master who
						was a very good Man, used to sing <lb/> Verses before &amp; after Meals of
						which the following made a particular <lb/> Impression upon me: We thank the
							<roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for this our Food; but more
						<lb/> for <persName type="deity">Jesus</persName> Flesh &amp; Blood the
						Manna to the Spirit giv'n the living Bread <lb/> sent down from
							<placeName type="biblical">Heav'n</placeName>. At Nights our Master
						used to kneel <lb/> down with us, &amp; oftens pray'd very heartily
						that our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> might <lb/> preserve us from every bad thing &amp;
						lead us in the way to everlasting <lb/> Life. We Children kept also Meetings
						among ourselves &amp; when we <lb/> went into the Fields, we sometimes
						kneel'd down under the Hedges &amp; <lb/> pray'd to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in a
						Childlike simple manner. When I was about <lb/>
						<date when-iso="1753" cert="medium">12 years of age</date> I went to <name event="ecclesiastical">Service</name>, where I had it very hard, nor did </p>

					<p> I get enough to eat. <date when-iso="1755" cert="medium">After 2 Years</date> I went to
						another place, where I <lb/> had it better in outward respects, but was much
						exposed to bad and <lb/> hurtful Company, so that I lost those good
						Impressions which I had <lb/> as a Child, &amp; a Desire for the World &amp;
						is Vanity took place in me. </p>
					<p> When <date when-iso="1760" cert="medium">I was about 19 Years old</date>,
						one of my former Masters wanted <lb/> me to enter again into his Service,
						with whom I also agreed, &amp; as <lb/> I learn'd afterwards, a Scheme
						was laid, that if I had come there, <lb/> I very likely should have settled
						&amp; been entirely lost in the things of <lb/> this World; but before the
						time came quite on, I went to see my <lb/> Mother &amp; Sister, who
						persuaded me to go &amp; work as a <rs ref="mlocc000034" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontology/cwrc#Occupation" cert="high">Mason</rs> on
						the <lb/> Fortification, which was then to be build, tho' I never had
						been em- <lb/> ploy'd as a <rs ref="mlocc000034" type="http://sparql.cwrc.ca/ontology/cwrc#Occupation" cert="high">Mason</rs>
						before, but I got Tools &amp; went, &amp; the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> to <lb/> whom I pray'd, helped me, so that I could
						go on with the work &amp; there- <lb/> by all Dangers, which awaited me, if
						I had gone again to Service, <lb/> were prevented. Living now with my
						Mother, she asked me to go with <lb/> her to <name event="ecclesiastical">divine
							Service</name>, which I did, as I had no particular Choise in <lb/> this
						Respect. After I had been to hear <persName><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Nyberg</persName> several
						times he spoke <lb/> to me &amp; invited me to call &amp; see him, which I
						did the Sunday after, when <lb/> we had had some Conversation together, he
						told me, that now the <lb/>
						<orgName>Society</orgName> would have a meeting &amp; I might be present; As
						soon as I <lb/> entered the Room, I was seized with <name type="emotion">an
							holy awe</name> &amp; the praying <lb/> of the Litany in that Meeting
						made such an Impression upon me <lb/> that I not only looked upon them as
						true Children of <persName type="deity">God</persName>, but became <lb/>
						also seriously concerned about myself. I then went to the <name event="ecclesiastical">Meeting</name>

						<name type="emotion">make me happy &amp; give me the assurance thereof in my

						made me free from them all. <lb/> As we lived about 3 Miles distant from
							<placeName ref="mlpla000201">Haverforthwest</placeName>, &amp; my <lb/> Mother was not so
						well cared for as I could wish, I took a House <lb/> &amp; moved with her to

						<lb/> &amp; had many a Visit from our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> in the Converse with him; As
						well <lb/> in my Sleeping place, as when I took a walk in the Fields &amp;
						once <lb/> in particular when I walked by the River Side, He appeared to my
						poor <lb/> heart &amp; assured me that I should be His &amp; that he has
						shed his Blood for <lb/> all my Sins; <date when-iso="1768-03-31">March

					<p> to dwell upon the faults of others &amp; thereby farther hurt was <lb/> prevented. He
