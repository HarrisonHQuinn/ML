					Sarah Gurney. <lb />
					I was Born in Mimms Middlesex, Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1745.  My Parents <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> of the <lb />
					Church of England wherein I was Baptiz&apos;d &amp; brought up. In my Childhood <lb />
					I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp; alreadly then believed that I must <lb />
					attain to something at yet unpossess&apos;d, or I could not be saved.  My natural diss- <lb />
					position was flighty so that what tender impressions I had in my heart, <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> <lb />
					of short duration. When I was 13 years old a Discenting Gentlewoman took <lb />
					me into her family, where I was instructed in <del>those</del> <add place="above">the</add> principles <add place="above">of that denomination</add>; I read their <lb />
					Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which frighten&apos;d <lb />
					me exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour&apos;d <lb />
					to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading, <lb />
					praying &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer&apos;d before those of the <lb />
					E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In 1730 my <lb />
					Father being sick I visited him &amp; was greatly concerned for his Salvation, <lb />
					&amp; therefore kneel&apos;d down by his bed, read &amp; pray&apos;d by him, putting the Bible <lb />
					into his Hands, when he open&apos;d to that portion of Scripture, Remember <lb />
					thy Creator in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may <lb />
					not be hid from thine Eyes. This so Affected me that I immediately rose up, <lb />
					giving up all the concern I had for my dear Fathers happiness, trusting to <lb />
					this Lord for his Salvation, taking those words as a demand from God upon <lb />
					me; nevertheless the loss of so affectionate a Parent affected me so, that I <lb />
					wish&apos;d to be buried with him, believing I shou&apos;d never care for life any more. <lb />
					In 1733 my Lady also departed &amp; I return&apos;d to London, where I waited on 2 <lb />
					young Ladies, who with their Mother Lady Askew <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> of the E. Church <lb />
					but lived in all the gayeties of this world. Here I forgot my former resolutions, <lb />
					I went into all manner of those so called innocent diversions viz Cards, <lb />
					Dancing, plays &amp; yet not without strong convictions which at times caused <lb />
					me very heavy reflections. In this family I was in the way of many &amp; great <lb />
					temptations, so that at length I was obliged to leave my place, &amp; got another <lb />
					in Putney, where all my convictions return&apos;d, &amp; a deep sense of my miserable <lb />
					condition caused a melancholy to overwhelm me, which notwithstanding the <lb />
					advise &amp; admonitions of Ministers &amp; who endeavor&apos;d to persuade me that I <lb />
					enough yet I was convinced of the contrary &amp; wanted to find out a <lb />
					of God, for I firmly believed there were such in the world &amp; that they 
					<note type="catchword">could</note>

					could help me. The housekeeper in the family being a relation of the late <lb />
					B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams, <del>she</del> invited him one day to Tea, which gave me an oppertunity <lb />
					(when she went out) to ask him what religion he was of? He told me the Church <lb />
					of England; I being concern&apos;d &amp; he appearing the same to me, I took the freedom <lb />
					to ask him of he always went to the Church, he ans&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not always; I desir&apos;d <lb />
					to know where then; he told me there was a religious Society in Fetter Lane. <lb />
					I ask&apos;d him if I might have leave to come? he said yes, as also told me the <lb />
					time of they meetings &amp; promis&apos;d (it being winter) to come for me, which he <lb />
					faithfully did the next Sunday at 5 in the morning. Here I heard B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Brown <lb />
					preach from the Text He was wounded for our transgressions, he was <lb />
					bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, &amp; with <lb />
					his stripes we are healed. We had not set long before the people from <lb />
					without peltered us with stores &amp; bricks breaking the windows &amp; doing much <lb />
					mischief, so that I was very much frightened &amp; not able to attend to the Sermon. <lb />
					The late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loyd by whom I sat bad me be compos&apos;d, for she had that <lb />
					confidence in the Lord that he would not suffer us to be hurt, &amp; when the <lb />
					preaching was over ask&apos;d me how I had lik&apos;d it? I ans<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I could not tell, <lb />
					for altho&apos; I was very desirous to to sav&apos;d, yet I believed I shou&apos;d never come any <lb />
					more there, for I was terribly frighten&apos;d, &amp; thought that thereby I risk&apos;d my <lb />
					life, consequently I went no more for 3 years, during which time I was wishing <lb />
					much to get into a Nunery, &amp; did all in my power to attain to the same, but <lb />
					as I was informed that I must go to France, for which I had not ability <lb />
					otherwise then as a servant, which I did not chuse, as I was informed they <lb />
					would use me as their slave, <add place="above">I dropt that scheme</add>; At this time there was to be a confirmation <lb />
					in the Church, when I consequently with many other young women was <lb />
					confirm&apos;d by the Bishop, &amp; the Sunday following partook of the Lord&apos;s <lb />
					Supper during which I felt the Lord blessed me. After all this I got <lb />
					an inclination to go again to Fetter Lane &amp; found there was a Congn settled <lb />
					&amp; all stillness, where I again met with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Willams &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Loyd whom I knew, <lb />
					I was directly assured in my heart that they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of God, &amp; that to <lb />
					them I belonged. I was priviledged with going to all the meetings on that <lb />
					day, whereby I was more devinely assur&apos;d of my heavenly calling. The <lb />
					following week B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams sent me a note to come the next Sunday,

					when I should see some pilgrim B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, I did not understand <lb />
					his meaning, yet when I was present at a meeting, held to the S. Women <lb />
					by the late <del>Disciple</del> <add place="above">ordinary of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></add> in German which B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spaningburg interpreted <lb />
					&amp; at which was present Anna Nitchman, Benigna &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Anna LaTrobe <lb />
					I soon understood they were the pilgrims that I was come to see. <lb />
					My coming to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> was kept secret from the family for 3/4 of a <lb />
					year till at length they got intelligence that I went after a religious <lb />
					sect of people, which bore an indifferent character, &amp; they fearing the <lb />
					consequence sent for the Minister which had me confirm&apos;d, he questioned <lb />
					me very strictly about the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, &amp; ask&apos;d me whether I realy knew that I <lb />
					was going among a pearcel of strolers. I told him he must be mistaken <lb />
					for I was convinc&apos;d they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of God; he said how had I come <lb />
					to this knowledge? I told him I had felt it in my heart, that there was <lb />
					no salvation but in the Gospel they preached thro&apos; faith in our Saviour <lb />
					to the forgiveness of sins; upon which he wish&apos;d me to say what sins <lb />
					I had committed, I ans<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> him I felt myself full of sin, altho&apos; I had been <lb />
					preserved from outward transgressions &amp; knew I must have forgiveness <lb />
					otherwise I cou&apos;d not saved. He ask&apos;d me many more questions, so that <lb />
					at length I grew quite weary went &amp; fetch&apos;d him all the Books that <lb />
					I had then in my possession of the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> &amp; desir&apos;d him to read them <lb />
					atentively &amp; then return them again; with this I left him at that time <lb />
					but in a few days he sent for me to his House return&apos;d me the Books and <lb />
					saying he would have me consider it well over before I left the <lb />
					Church. I told him, I knew what I was about, as also the people &amp; <lb />
					wish&apos;d he knew them as well. After this conversation he came to our <lb />
					House &amp; desir&apos;d my M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to part with me, I being a very dangerous <lb />
					person &amp; enough to infect her whole House. I felt an exceeding great <lb />
					love for the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> people &amp; wish&apos;d more earnestly for a nearer connection <lb />
					&amp; beg&apos;d our Saviour to make known his love in my heart, &amp; from this <lb />
					time was convinced had no righteousness, therefore ceased not to pray <lb />
					our Saviour for forgiveness &amp; that he wou&apos;d cloth me with his righte- <lb />
					ousness, which soon after I felt in my heart &amp; was as a new born child so <lb />
					free; it was as if our dear Saviour had shed his blood alone for me, I was <lb />
					quite happy &amp; every way well. This happiness lasted about 3 months, 
					<note type="catchword">but</note>

					but not knowing my own poverty &amp; weakness &amp; that I stood in need of <lb />
					renewed Grace every moment, I grew dark &amp; miserable &amp; reason&apos;d against our <lb />
					Saviour feeling an unwillingness to be stript of everything &amp; saved alone <lb />
					by him, I was often frightened at the sight of my self &amp; was wretched to <lb />
					the last degree: but the dear H. Ghost ceased not that work which he has <lb />
					begun in my heart but as I afterwards found all was unmerited grace &amp; <lb />
					favor. I took the Hymn Book up in my distress &amp; open&apos;d to that Verse ye <lb />
					wounds of Jesus bless me now &amp; blood of Jesus flow me thro&apos; &amp;c. &amp; I found again <lb />
					confidence to our Saviour. I came again to London &amp; was hirred in M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Raymonds <lb />
					family. 1747 I was rec&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which was really blessed to me &amp; <lb />
					felt a longing desire to partake of the H. Sacrament, but a deep sense of my own <lb />
					unworthiness &amp; the feeling of my wretched nature made me afraid to venture <lb />
					on so sacred a matter, therefore waited 2 years longer, when I had a particular <lb />
					favorable opportunity with Anna Nitchman &amp;  A. <add place="above">Johanna</add> in Red Lyon Square <lb />
					who advis&apos;d me to leave my place, which I readily did &amp; came to live with S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					Stonehouse, I was soon admitted to the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which made a lasting, <lb />
					impression on my heart for I knew &amp; felt I fed on the Lords body &amp; blood, but <lb />
					nevertheless I often hinder&apos;d myself of many blessings thro&apos; unfaithfullness <lb />
					which occasioned often hours of distress, but the dear H. Ghost often repre- <lb />
					sented to my heart the sufferings &amp; dying love of Jesus to procure my peace <lb />
					which made me truly ashamed &amp; a real <add place="above">humble</add> sinner. After my M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> decease I <lb />
					I was sent by our dear A. Nitchman to the Boys <del>Oeconomy</del> <add place="above">Nursery</add> in Mile end <lb />
					where I enjoy&apos;d a very happy period &amp; sabatic season. 1754 I came to S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish <lb />
					in Linsey House from whence in May 1755 we set out for Hhuth where we <lb />
					arrived July 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> here I was with my whole heart which made my time pass the <lb />
					better with my much respected S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish. After her happy Departure I had <lb />
					the favor to go to the C <add place="above">Choir</add> house, where I have enjoy&apos;d many unspeakable <lb />
					blessings for my poor heart, particularly in the C C<add place="above">hoir</add> meetings which the late Count <lb />
					<del>Disciple</del> kept in Bethelsdorf to which I went. In this <add place="above">Choir</add> House <add place="above">at</add> Hhuth I learnt <lb />
					to know myself better, which has prov&apos;d a wholesome school to me, &amp; for which I <lb />
					shall feel greatful to my latest breath. March 1758 I was admitted among <lb />
					the Intercessors which <del>opportunities</del> has prov&apos;d salutary &amp; blessed to me <lb />
					after which I liv&apos;d 4 years in the Child<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Oeconomy &amp; then rec&apos;d a call to Fulneck <lb />
					to be among the Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> there where, I also remain&apos;d 4 years, &amp; then came to live <lb />
					and the C <add place="above">Choir</add> House here where, I have been ever since thousand, thousand <lb />
					thanks be rendered to my gracious Lord &amp; Saviour who has led me thus far, &amp; assured <lb />
					me of my everlasting happiness in him.

							<del>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney <lb />
							I have to add the following</del>: Since I came into the single sisters house <lb />
							at Fulneck the Holy Ghost took me into his school, &amp; showed me that <lb />
							I ought to love our Saviour more than I did &amp; that I had not that earnest <lb />
							desire which I should have for the manifestation of his love to me. Though <lb />
							he had followed me from my infancy, yet now he discovered my depravity <lb />
							poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular <lb />
							manner, I was in darkness sometimes through unbelief &amp; the feeling of my <lb />
							misery, &amp; if it one not for his love &amp; pitty he would have taken his grace from <lb />
							me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly <lb />
							that without him there is no happiness, I felt my lost estate but he drew me <lb />
							near to himself &amp; did not let me rest till I could by faith apply his <add place="above">Atone</add> <lb />
							ments <add place="above">to myself</add> &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been <lb />
							more faithful to his leading I should have experienced more happiness &amp; have <lb />
							been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness <lb />
							&amp; that so very slowly toward the mark I press, but Jesus comforts me, who out <lb />
							mercy free me all my guilt with patience in the accursed tree. Now my <lb />
							hearts inclination is a deep prostration for my Saviours pain, To be therby <lb />
							melted so that each one felt it how I love that Man. May his love be <lb />
							be all my own &amp; may I in future love him with my whole heart  <lb />
							<del>from here to eternity</del> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can <lb />
							never praise <add place="above">him</add> sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy child. <lb />
							His Holy Spirit often reproved <add place="above">me,</add> but when with contrition I <add place="above">owned all</add> to him, he <lb />
							forgave me again, In short I live by his forgiveness. He <del>I was</del> <add place="above">cared</add> for me <lb />
							with <add place="above">the</add> tenderness of a Mother. O that I could praise my heavenly Father and my <lb />
							Saviour <del>&amp; I could</del> better than I do! O that I <del>did</del> <add place="above">might</add> never forget his mercies to me <lb />
							<del>which alas I have often done</del> <del>by he</del> <add place="above">and tho&apos; I have often to my great loss been forgetful, yet he</add> my great Saviour still remained the same <lb />
							For <del>was</del> <add place="above">which I now</add> will praise him as well as I can, &amp; <del>will</del> <add place="above">shall</add> do it better when I see him. <lb />
							<del>Thus far her own words, to which her Sisters added the following.</del>
