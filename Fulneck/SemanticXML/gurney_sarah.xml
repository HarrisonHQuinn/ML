					<persName ref="#mlper000246" cert="high" type="real">Sarah Gurney</persName>. <lb/>
					I was <name event="birth" when-iso="1745-10-27">Born</name> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000137" cert="high">Mimms Middlesex</placeName>, <date when="1745-10-27" cert="high">Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> the 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1745</date>.  My Parents <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> of the <lb/>
					<orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> wherein I was <name event="baptism">Baptiz'd</name> &amp; brought up. In my Childhood <lb/>
					I was convinced of sin &amp; felt I was not right &amp; alreadly then believed that I must <lb/>
					attain to something at yet unpossess'd, or I could not be saved.  My natural diss- <lb/>
					position was flighty so that what tender impressions I had in my heart, <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> <lb/>
					of short duration. When I was <date cert="medium" when="1758">13 years old</date> a Discenting Gentlewoman took <lb/>
					me into her family, where I was instructed in <del>those</del> <add place="above">the</add> principles <add place="above">of that denomination</add>; I read their <lb/>
					Bookes &amp; particularly Backesters Call to the unconverted, which frighten'd <lb/>
					me exceedingly, for I felt I fell short of all righteousness, &amp; therefore endeavour'd <lb/>
					to reform my life by more strict observance of my duty, especially by reading, <lb/>
					praying &amp; frequenting the meetings, which I prefer'd before those of the <lb/>
					E. Church, because I thought these people were more sincere. In <date when="1730" cert="high">1730</date> my <lb/>
					Father being sick I visited him &amp; was greatly concerned for his Salvation, <lb/>
					&amp; therefore kneel'd down by his bed, read &amp; pray'd by him, putting the Bible <lb/>
					into his Hands, when he open'd to that portion of Scripture, Remember <lb/>
					thy <roleName type="honorific">Creator</roleName> in the days of thy youth, that when thou art old he may <lb/>
					not be hid from thine Eyes. This so Affected me that I immediately rose up, <lb/>
					giving up all the concern I had for my dear Fathers happiness, trusting to <lb/>
					this <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> for his Salvation, taking those words as a demand from <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName> upon <lb/>
					me; nevertheless the loss of so affectionate a Parent affected me so, that I <lb/>
					wish'd to be buried with him, believing I shou'd never care for life any more. <lb/>
					In <date when="1733" cert="high">1733</date> my Lady also departed &amp; I return'd to <placeName ref="#mlpla000054" cert="high">London</placeName>, where I waited on 2 <lb/>
					young Ladies, who with their Mother Lady Askew <del>was</del> <add place="above">were</add> of the E. Church <lb/>
					but lived in all the gayeties of this world. Here I forgot my former resolutions, <lb/>
					I went into all manner of those so called innocent diversions viz Cards, <lb/>
					Dancing, plays &amp; yet not without strong convictions which at times caused <lb/>
					me very heavy reflections. In this family I was in the way of many &amp; great <lb/>
					temptations, so that at length I was obliged to leave my place, &amp; got another <lb/>
					in <placeName ref="#mlpla000239" cert="high">Putney</placeName>, where all my convictions return'd, &amp; a deep sense of my miserable <lb/>
					condition caused a melancholy to overwhelm me, which notwithstanding the <lb/>
					advise &amp; admonitions of Ministers &amp; who endeavor'd to persuade me that I <lb/>
					enough yet I was convinced of the contrary &amp; wanted to find out a <lb/>
					of <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>, for I firmly believed there were such in the world &amp; that they 
					<note type="catchword">could</note>

					could help me. The housekeeper in the family being a relation of the late <lb/>
					<persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Williams</persName>, <del>she</del> invited him one day to Tea, which gave me an oppertunity <lb/>
					(when she went out) to ask him what religion he was of? He told me the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church
<lb/>
of England</orgName>; I being concern'd &amp; he appearing the same to me, I took the freedom <lb/>
					to ask him of he always went to the Church, he ans'<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> not always; I desir'd <lb/>
					to know where then; he told me there was a <orgName religion="Moravian Church">religious Society</orgName> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000004" cert="high">Fetter Lane</placeName>. <lb/>
					I ask'd him if I might have leave to come? he said yes, as also told me the <lb/>
					time of they meetings &amp; promis'd (it being winter) to come for me, which he <lb/>
					faithfully did the next Sunday at 5 in the morning. Here I heard <persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Brown</persName> <lb/>
					preach from the Text He was wounded for our transgressions, he was <lb/>
					bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, &amp; with <lb/>
					his stripes we are healed. We had not set long before the people from <lb/>
					without peltered us with stores &amp; bricks breaking the windows &amp; doing much <lb/>
					mischief, so that I was very much frightened &amp; not able to attend to the Sermon. <lb/>
					The late <persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Loyd</persName> by whom I sat bad me be compos'd, for she had that <lb/>
					confidence in the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> that he would not suffer us to be hurt, &amp; when the <lb/>
					preaching was over ask'd me how I had lik'd it? I ans<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> I could not tell, <lb/>
					for altho' I was very desirous to to sav'd, yet I believed I shou'd never come any <lb/>
					more there, for I was terribly frighten'd, &amp; thought that thereby I risk'd my <lb/>
					life, consequently I went no more for 3 years, during which time I was wishing <lb/>
					much to get into a Nunery, &amp; did all in my power to attain to the same, but <lb/>
					as I was informed that I must go to <placeName ref="#mlpla000240" cert="high">France</placeName>, for which I had not ability <lb/>
					otherwise then as a servant, which I did not chuse, as I was informed they <lb/>
					would use me as their slave, <add place="above">I dropt that scheme</add>; At this time there was to be a confirmation <lb/>
					in the Church, when I consequently with many other young women was <lb/>
					<name event="confirmation">confirm'd by the Bishop</name>, &amp; the Sunday following <name event="communion">partook of the Lord's
<lb/>
Supper</name> during which I felt the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> blessed me. After all this I got <lb/>
					an inclination to go again to <placeName ref="#mlpla000004" cert="high">Fetter Lane</placeName> &amp; found there was a Congn settled <lb/>
					&amp; all stillness, where I again met with <persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Willams</persName> &amp; <persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName>Loyd</persName> whom I knew, <lb/>
					I was directly assured in my heart that they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>, &amp; that to <lb/>
					them I belonged. I was priviledged with going to all the meetings on that <lb/>
					day, whereby I was more devinely assur'd of my heavenly calling. The <lb/>
					following week <persName cert="high" type="real">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Williams</persName> sent me a note to come the next Sunday,

					when I should see some pilgrim B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, I did not understand <lb/>
					his meaning, yet when I was present at a meeting, held to the <orgName en="single sisters choir">S. Women</orgName> <lb/>
					by the late <del>Disciple</del> <add place="above">ordinary of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></add> in <placeName ref="#mlpla000139" cert="high">German</placeName> which <persName ref="#mlper000602" cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> Spaningburg</persName> interpreted <lb/>

					I soon understood they were the pilgrims that I was come to see. <lb/>
					My coming to the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> was kept secret from the family for 3/4 of a <lb/>
					year till at length they got intelligence that I went after a religious <lb/>
					sect of people, which bore an indifferent character, &amp; they fearing the <lb/>
					consequence sent for the <name memoirSubject="n" office="#mloff000002">Minister</name> which had me confirm'd, he questioned <lb/>
					me very strictly about the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName>, &amp; ask'd me whether I realy knew that I <lb/>
					was going among a pearcel of strolers. I told him he must be mistaken <lb/>
					for I was convinc'd they were Child<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> of <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>; he said how had I come <lb/>
					to this knowledge? I told him I had felt it in my heart, that there was <lb/>
					no salvation but in the Gospel they preached thro' faith in our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> <lb/>
					to the forgiveness of sins; upon which he wish'd me to say what sins <lb/>
					I had committed, I ans<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> him I felt myself full of sin, altho' I had been <lb/>
					preserved from outward transgressions &amp; knew I must have forgiveness <lb/>
					otherwise I cou'd not saved. He ask'd me many more questions, so that <lb/>
					at length I grew quite weary went &amp; fetch'd him all the Books that <lb/>
					I had then in my possession of the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> &amp; desir'd him to read them <lb/>
					atentively &amp; then return them again; with this I left him at that time <lb/>
					but in a few days he sent for me to his House return'd me the Books and <lb/>
					saying he would have me consider it well over before I left the <lb/>
					Church. I told him, I knew what I was about, as also the people &amp; <lb/>
					wish'd he knew them as well. After this conversation he came to our <lb/>
					House &amp; desir'd my M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to part with me, I being a very dangerous <lb/>
					person &amp; enough to infect her whole House. I felt an exceeding great <lb/>
					love for the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi></orgName> people &amp; wish'd more earnestly for a nearer connection <lb/>
					&amp; beg'd our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> to make known his love in my heart, &amp; from this <lb/>
					time was convinced had no righteousness, therefore ceased not to pray <lb/>
					our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> for forgiveness &amp; that he wou'd cloth me with his righte- <lb/>
					ousness, which soon after I felt in my heart &amp; was as a new born child so <lb/>
					free; it was as if our dear <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> had shed his blood alone for me, I was <lb/>
					quite happy &amp; every way well. This happiness lasted about 3 months,

					but not knowing my own poverty &amp; weakness &amp; that I stood in need of <lb/>
					renewed Grace every moment, I grew dark &amp; miserable &amp; reason'd against our <lb/>
					<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> feeling an unwillingness to be stript of everything &amp; saved alone <lb/>
					by him, I was often frightened at the sight of my self &amp; was wretched to <lb/>
					the last degree: but the dear <roleName type="honorific">H. Ghost</roleName> ceased not that work which he has <lb/>
					begun in my heart but as I afterwards found all was unmerited grace &amp; <lb/>

							<del>Continuation of the life of Sarah Gurney <lb/>
							I have to add the following</del>: Since I came into the <orgName en="single sisters choir">single sisters</orgName> house <lb/>
							at <placeName ref="#mlpla000003" cert="high">Fulneck</placeName> the <roleName type="honorific">Holy Ghost</roleName> took me into his school, &amp; showed me that <lb/>
							I ought to love our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> more than I did &amp; that I had not that earnest <lb/>
							desire which I should have for the manifestation of his love to me. Though <lb/>
							he had followed me from my infancy, yet now he discovered my depravity <lb/>
							poverty &amp; helplessness returning my abode in the sisters house in a particular <lb/>
							manner, I was in darkness sometimes through unbelief &amp; the feeling of my <lb/>
							misery, &amp; if it one not for his love &amp; pitty he would have taken his grace from <lb/>
							me but he did not, but from time to time helped me, letting me see clearly <lb/>
							that without him there is no happiness, I felt my lost estate but he drew me <lb/>
							near to himself &amp; did not let me rest till I could by faith apply his <add place="above">Atone</add> <lb/>
							ments <add place="above">to myself</add> &amp; know that I was his &amp; he was mine. If I had been <lb/>
							more faithful to his leading I should have experienced more happiness &amp; have <lb/>
							been more to his honor. I am still his poor child. I see &amp; feel my sinfulness <lb/>
							&amp; that so very slowly toward the mark I press, but <persName type="real" cert="high">Jesus</persName> comforts me, who out <lb/>
							mercy free me all my guilt with patience in the accursed tree. Now my <lb/>
							hearts inclination is a deep prostration for my <roleName type="honorific">Saviours</roleName> pain, To be therby <lb/>
							melted so that each one felt it how I love that Man. May his love be <lb/>
							be all my own &amp; may I in future love him with my whole heart  <lb/>
							<del>from here to eternity</del> though I shall fall short in time &amp; eternity. I can <lb/>
							never praise <add place="above">him</add> sufficiently for what he has done to me his worthy child. <lb/>
							His <roleName type="honorific">Holy Spirit</roleName> often reproved <add place="above">me,</add> but when with contrition I <add place="above">owned all</add> to him, he <lb/>
							forgave me again, In short I live by his forgiveness. He <del>I was</del> <add place="above">cared</add> for me <lb/>
							with <add place="above">the</add> tenderness of a Mother. O that I could praise my heavenly Father and my <lb/>
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> <del>&amp; I could</del> better than I do! O that I <del>did</del> <add place="above">might</add> never forget his mercies to me <lb/>
							<del>which alas I have often done</del> <del>by he</del> <add place="above">and tho' I have often to my great loss been forgetful, yet he</add> my great <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> still remained the same <lb/>
							For <del>was</del> <add place="above">which I now</add> will praise him as well as I can, &amp; <del>will</del> <add place="above">shall</add> do it better when I see him. <lb/>
							<del>Thus far her own words, to which her Sisters added the following.</del>
