						&amp; when I was alone often pray'd to our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName> to have Mercy upon me &amp; keep &amp; preserve me from
						all Sin. At ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> the <date when-iso="1736" cert="medium">age of 15</date>, I left off all Pleasures &amp; became acquainted with a small

					<p> inward Grief prey'd upon him, of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was sensible &amp; wo<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speak of at times with concern. All this seem'd
						to impair his Body &amp; <hi rend="strikethrough">of the after land carnal which </hi> He often said &amp; wrote that his chief Busyness &amp; concern was now to he

					<p> Last spring He had a very severe attack of the stone Cholick of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> He Recovr'd so as to be active in his Office, yet the Effects were Visible.
						He had a second fitt of sickness with an Inflamation in his Face &amp; a violent pain in his Head by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he was confin'd to his Room ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> a fortnight, but was again so well Recover'd as to go about, but his Constitution was apparently weaken'd w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> rais'd the apprehensions of his going home of w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he spoke frequent- ly with desire. He preached on the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> to a very large Auditory with Life &amp; Energy, of the efficacious power in Jesus' Blood &amp; Death to make us New Creatures, and his last meeting kept in
						the Hall was a Discourse to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> for the Conclusion of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> Day on the
						W. W<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>"Shew forth his Salvation from Day to Day." which he eamestly Recomended to the Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to put in practice in Life &amp; Conversation,&amp; entreated our D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord, kneeling to happily effect it with each

						a Boil w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> gathered on his Shoulder &amp; was attended with much pain &amp; inflam'd his Back w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> threw him into a
						Bilious Fever. Even during his sickness he shew'd his wonted paternal heart in Counsel &amp; Friedship to those who came to him, as long as he had strength to speak. He
						was tender &amp; loving to all, saying once "I have nothing against any one &amp; hope no one has any thing against me. <note type="catchword">we</note>

					<p> we were still in hopes that by the discharge of the Abcess in his Back (w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> was pretty large) his Constitution might have been Reliev'd &amp;
						he Restor'd to Health, but on the 29th ab<hi rend="superscript">t </hi> 2 in the Morning we observ'd an Alteration &amp; that the weight of his disorder was fallen
						upon his Lungs, then it became evident that our gracious Lord intended to take him soon into his Joy, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> he himself expect- ed wo<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be accomplished by the sametime real moving, amidst his pain &amp; weakness. He spent his time in such a tender loving &amp; Paternal manner
						towards all &amp; especially towards his dear wife &amp; Niece, &amp; those by orphans to whom he had been Guardian, &amp; in looking ardently to his faithful Lord in
						expectation of the happy Moments quick approach; that it was truly edifying to all who came near him.</p>
					<p> After 12 o Clock in the Night he ask'd what were the Texts for the Day, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> being Read as follows, the W: W<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>.
						"My Soul breaketh for longing that it hath unto thy Judgments at all times" Feelest thou the Blood Churches ardent Longings Cheek bedew'd with Million Tears
						forth thronging from th' enamour'd Churches Face? And the Text,. "Righteousness shall be the Girdle of his Loins &amp; faithfulness the Girdle of his
						Reins." With the whole merit of thy Life, Bless us O d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord &amp; god;" of which He took great notice, saying, how comfortable &amp;
						pretty they were, believing confidently the time drew near when Faith sho<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> be turn'd into Vision. when the Clock struck two, he seem'd
						something disappointed that he was yet here, &amp; when another hour was elapesd, He look'd up in an earnest manner, &amp; expressed in his great weakness &amp; pain </p>

					<p> his Desire to his d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lord, to take him to himself complaining that this hour had been very long. Thus he continued looking for the happy moment
						being quite Sensible, &amp; when He co<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>speake no more, his Looks &amp; Gestures discouend the object his Soul was engaged with, &amp; about half
						past Six his Lips turn'd Pale in Jesus' Arms &amp; bosom with the Blessing of the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> during a blessed Liturgy. A very happy Sensation
						of our d<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>Lord's presence was felt during this Night by the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> present,
						&amp; many Tears accompanied his precious Soul to it eternal home. </p>
