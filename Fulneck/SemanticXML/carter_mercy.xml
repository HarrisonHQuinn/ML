					<hi rend="underlined">Occurrences in Wike Cong</hi><hi rend="underlined superscript">n</hi><hi rend="underlined"> for the Month of Jan. 1771</hi> <lb />
					<del>The 4th</del>
						<add place="above">Out of Wyk Plan</add> our dear S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Mercy Carter went to our Saviour <add place="above">On the 4<hi rend="superscript"
								>th</hi> Jan.</add> Of her <lb />
					Course thro' this World the following is to be observed:
				</p>
			<p>
					She was born at Greatland in Hallifax Parish: March 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
					1716, and brught up in the establishd Church. Her Parents depar- <lb />
					ting this Life when she was very young, and they being at the same <lb />
					time but low in the World, she was cared for by the Town to which <lb />
					she belong'd. and tho' she was in the midst of the World in her 19<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
					and 20<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Years, yet she could not be brought in the comon sinful <lb />
					Track thereof, partly oweing to an invisible Hand of Preservation <lb />
					from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, and partly to Stirrings and Convictions she had <lb />
					in her Heart from her earliest Remembrance. This Spark, which <lb />
					lay in her soul from a Child, was fed and nurish'd by the Testi- <lb />
					mony she heard of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham and M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dellamot of the free grace <lb />
					in Jesus Blood and Death. and being very anxious and Restless <lb />
					for the Forgiveness of her Sins and true life out of Jesus in her <lb />
					Heart, she followed the Course and Track peculiar to those times, <lb />
					in hearing the Reaching of the Gospel; But her poor Soul never <lb />
					found Deliverance and Peace, <add place="above">till</add> in the Year 1739, <add place="above">when</add> she once heard <lb />
					our dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Beohler, during which our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> manifested, <lb />
					himself to her, so as he sweated Bloody in the Garden of <lb />
					Gethsemane on her account: This not only gave her love and <lb />
					Peace, but life and love.
				</p>
			<p>
					In 1746 a Society of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> <lb />
					was settled at Greetland, to which she belong'd from the Begining. <lb />
					In 1746 she <add place="above">was</add> married to the present Widower. When the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> <lb />
					removed from Newhouse, she and her Husband moved with <lb />
					our B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Jeremy Carter into the same in order to be nearer the <lb />
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> into which she was received at Fulneck May 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1759 <lb />
					and the following year <hi rend="strikethrough">in</hi> Sep<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>: 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> she with her Husband enjoy'd <lb />
					the holy Comunion for the first time with the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. Their <lb />
					Marriage has been bless'd with 4 Child<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, 1 is already with the <lb />
					Lord, and 1Son and 1 Daughter are in the respective Choir <lb />
					Houses at Fulneck, for which she was inexpressibly thankful <lb />
					to our dear Lord.

					she being an applied of solid Sister, and as such respected by <lb />
					our People, she was accordingly made use of as a Helper in <lb />
					a Band; and when the late Helpers Conference was settled  <lb />
					she became a Member thereof. Our late Sister had a peculiar <lb />
					Talent for visiting her Sisters, and contriving to relieve the <lb />
					needy and those in Distress. When in the dayly Course of <lb />
					her House affairs, she got an impulse to visit this as the <lb />
					other Sister, either confined by Sickness, or whereever she felt it <lb />
					was necessary, she acquainted her Husband with her Intention <lb />
					and recommended herself to him for that Purpose; and he <lb />
					during her absense would Sigh to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in her behalf, <lb />
					that his aim with her Visiting might be answered; and <lb />
					when in the Evening she related to him of what had occurred, <lb />
					they both rejoiced together that our dear Lord had heard the <lb />
					Sighs of the one and blessed the weak Endeavours of the <lb />
					other.
				</p>
			<p>
					Whenever one of our Sisters was in external need, <lb />
					she used to go about among the heartiest Sisters, and pro <lb />
					pose to make a Collection for the Relief of such a one; <lb />
					in which she always succeeded, and as for her own Part <lb />
					in such a Case, her left hand did not know what her right <lb />
					Hand did.
				</p>
			<p>
					Thro' her very maternal and loving Way, peculiar to <lb />
					herself, she gain'd the affection of such Child<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> who were not <lb />
					her own, but about her in such a manner, that they would <lb />
					scarcey be seperated from her; and where ever she could <lb />
					invent any thing to be helpful to them wether it related to <lb />
					internal or external Matters, in order to secure them for <lb />
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, she left no Stone unturned, and as a Proof <lb />
					that our dear Lord was with her in this Respect she <lb />
					has left Trails behind her new in the single Sisters House <lb />
					at Fulneck
			</p>
			<cb />
			<p>
				
					the heaviest Circumstances, which she experienced during <lb />
					her course of grace, happened about a year and a half ago, <lb />
					when her eldest Son turning quite from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and the <lb />
					Inclinations and Convictions he had in his Heart, when among <lb />
					the Boys, so that the Steps he then took caused her much grief <lb />
					and trouble. and altho' she became comforted by our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					upon that head, that she could leave the Issue to his merciful <lb />
					heart, yet her sickly Tabernacle reiceved such a Shock thereby, <lb />
					that we are inclined to think it rather proved a Furtherance <lb />
					to her Dissolution. about 4 month ago she uttered the first <lb />
					apprehension that she should not be here long, for she said to <lb />
					her Husband when coming from the married festival last <lb />
					Septs this will be the last married festival I shall celebrate! <lb />
					an old Breast complaint which was renew'd by getting repeated <lb />
					later and a bad State of Blood, were seemingly the Cause of <lb />
					her going to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. about 2 Month ago she was the <lb />
					last time here of the h. Comunion, and tho' exceeding weak <lb />
					yet very much rejoiced to be once more together with her <lb />
					B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in so Solemn an Ocasion: for she was a very <lb />
					constant attender of all the Meetings. The nearer she <lb />
					drew to her End the more Childlike she became, and used to express <lb />
					herself thus, I want to be nothing else than my Saviours little <lb />
					Child! She was always much pleased and comforted when <lb />
					she was visited, especially by her Band Sisters: after our <lb />
					last Comunion B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Tander brough her her share <lb />
					after which she had long'd much and which she enjoy'd <lb />
					with great Eagerness together with her Husband. She being <lb />
					once asked how she was and felt in her Heart? she answered, <lb />
					my Heart is happy, I am my Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> little Child, He shall <lb />
					so with me what he pleases! On the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> instant B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					Tander call'd there, and finding her remarkably altered, <lb />
					told her, that she would soon be with her Redeemer, she

					answered: that's well, I have nothing to plead but his <lb />
					precious Blood and Rightousness. having sung a few <lb />
					verses with her, and telling her that she departed, <add place="above">to our dearest Lord</add> with the <lb />
					entire Blessing of his Church below, and she sitting by the fire <lb />
					side, she bowed down her Head in order to have it imparted <lb />
					to her; this being done, there was such a feeling of our <lb />
					dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Presence, that none present could refrain from <lb />
					shedding Tears. And tho' there was not an immediate <lb />
					Appearance of her going directly, yet after having taken <lb />
					leave of her Child<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> and those she had been like a Mother <lb />
					to, she laid down, and in about 4 Hours after, her happy <lb />
					Soul took its' Flight into the Wounds of Jesus.
