					Our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Eliz<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Coffin was born   <lb />
					<add place="above">near</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">at</hi> Elledmere, on the borders of Wales, <add place="above">A.D. 1777</add> <lb />
					her father being an extensive farmer. <lb />
					Of her earlier years, very little is <lb />
					known to us; as our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> left <lb />
					no memoranda of her course thro&apos; <lb />
					time. It appears however that <lb />
					her religious impressions were <lb />
					received early in life; &amp; she was accustomed <lb />
					to refer to one youthful experience <lb />
					as a turning proint in her <hi rend="strikethrough">experience</hi> <add place="above">course</add>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					Whilst attending the parish Church, <lb />
					some particular sentence in the morning <lb />
					prayer come home to her heart with <lb />
					such power, that she felt the love of  <lb />
					Christ as accomplishing her redemption.  <lb />
					She was <add place="above">thus</add> persuaded of her interest in <lb />
					his atonement, &amp; it is remarkable <lb />
					in the religious experience of our <lb />
					late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, that her course was not so <lb />
					subject to change &amp; deviation as

					that of the majority of the Lord&apos;s <lb />
					children. As far as her X<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> experience <lb />
					is known to us, she has alway spoken <lb />
					of his life of faith as a happy one; <lb />
					she knew no periods of gloom &amp; tasted <lb />
					not the bitterness of the soul from  <lb />
					whom the Lord&apos;s comforts are with <lb />
					drawn.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					As the age of 17 or 18, she removed <lb />
					to London, and entered the family <lb />
					of our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vowel <hi rend="strikethrough">with</hi> whom she <lb />
					lived till that lady&apos;s death. It <lb />
					was during her residence there, &amp; <lb />
					during B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Montgomry&apos;s service of <lb />
					the Congn that she joined the Church <lb />
					of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, of which she has been <lb />
					so many years a consistent member
			</p>
			<p>
				
					After S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Vowel&apos;s departure, she  <lb />
					remained with the 2 M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Youngs, the <lb />
					nephews <add place="above">of the deceased</add> till her own health began to fail.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					About the year 1820, she removed <lb />
					to Bristol, where she became an in <lb />
					mate, of the sisters house, during 
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
				
					B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Okelys&apos; ministry. Her stay <lb />
					in Bristol was but short, &amp; <lb />
					the subsequent years of her life,  <lb />
					up to her last removal in Fulneck, <lb />
					appear to have been somewhat un- <lb />
					settled as to her abode. She lived <lb />
					in Fulneck S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House for a few <lb />
					years; &amp; also spent some time again <lb />
					in London, &amp; with more than one <lb />
					family of her relatives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					In July 1831 <add place="above">i.e about</add> 24 years ago <lb />
					she settled finally on Fulneck, a <lb />
					place which seems above others to <lb />
					be that of her choice. Her <lb />
					walk among us here, her peculiarities <lb />
					her cheerful nature, her activitz &amp; <lb />
					especially her great love for the meetings <lb />
					for family &amp; public worship these <lb />
					are well known to many who this <lb />
					day see her mortal remains conveyed <lb />
					to their last resting place.  <lb />
				
			</p>
			<p>
				
					Being so long an invalid, her thoughts <lb />
					were often busied <add place="above">concerning</add> <hi rend="strikethrough">upon</hi> her own

					health whilst she inquired sympa- <lb />
					thisingly after the welfare of others.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					About a year ago, when speaking <lb />
					of a recent attack of illness, she re- <lb />
					marked I had sometimes the feeling <lb />
					that she Lord would take me to <lb />
					himself. Being asked whether she <lb />
					felt herself prepared for the last change <lb />
					she replied in her quick characteristic <lb />
					manner &amp; quite cheerfully -- It would <lb />
					be a great shame if I were not ready <lb />
					for it; for it is now 50 years since <lb />
					I first knew the Lord; &amp; since that <lb />
					time he has enabled me to serve <lb />
					Him It would be ungrateful in me <lb />
					to think he would not accept me <lb />
					at the last.&quot; 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					For the last twelve month <del>s</del> her <lb />
					health was perceived to her failing con- <lb />
					siderably tho&apos; she would not, till <lb />
					near the last, hear of seeking medi- <lb />
					cal advice. Tho&apos; she most often <lb />
					have been suffering from weakness <lb />
					&amp; pain she was still seen as her -
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
				
					place in the Prayer Hall &amp; Chapel <lb />
					where the meetings were always a <lb />
					source of spiritual enjoyment <add place="above">To her</add> &quot;As <lb />
					long as I can I must go&quot; she would <lb />
					say &quot;for soon I may not be able&quot;-
			</p>
			<p>
				
					Towards the close of last week, <lb />
					a<hi rend="strikethrough">s</hi> perceptible change was noticed in  <lb />
					her &amp; it be came evident to her friends, <lb />
					tho&apos; not as first to herself, that her <lb />
					time here below was drawing near <lb />
					it close. When her labouress <lb />
					alluded to the approaching end, &amp; asked <lb />
					her whether she felt ready for our Saviours <lb />
					coming, if it should please Him to  <lb />
					take her now, she answered, that <lb />
					she would like to feel Him nearer, but <lb />
					she had no fear.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					On Sunday, the last day of her <lb />
					life, tho&apos; growing very feeble, she <lb />
					retained a clear conciousness &amp; on <lb />
					unshaken faith. In reply to a question <lb />
					as to her spiritual support in this trouble <lb />
					she answered with energy &quot;I will trust <lb />
					Him tho&apos; he slay me.&quot; And again <lb />
					she said &quot;I care not what pain

					I have, if I have only <hi rend="underline">Him</hi> with me 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					For the attention of the Sisters &amp; <lb />
					friends to her in her illness, she was <lb />
					truly grateful, &amp; expressed herself <lb />
					surprised at the display of love <lb />
					which she witnessed. 
			</p>
			<p>
					On Sunday evening when her <lb />
					Laboress told her <del>she</del> our Savr <del>might</del> <add place="above">would probably</add> <lb />
					very soon come &amp; take her to himself, <lb />
					she seemed still somewhat surprised that <lb />
					her end should be so near; but was <lb />
					free from all apprehension of the event. <lb />
					Her feeling appeared to be that of the <lb />
					conviction &amp; confidence expressed <lb />
					in the Hymn 1184. 2 Thou knowst &amp;c.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					<note>Insert is at the bottom of second column, page 4.</note>
					*Insert <lb />
					She regretted B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Libbay&apos;s absence from <lb />
					the Congn at this time, much wishing to  <lb />
					live to see him again; as at the first, <lb />
					she appeared not right to have under- <lb />
					stood him in his Conversat with her.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					When asked if she wished to par <lb />
					take of the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> again, she replied <lb />
					somewhat doubtfull, -- I do not rest on <lb />
					<hi rend="underline">that</hi> - You know <hi rend="underline">He</hi> is my Bread of <lb />
					Life. 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					The same evening she received the  <lb />
					blessing of the Congn. imparted by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					Okely after a fervent prayer for the  <lb />
					nearness &amp; support of Jesus in this <lb />
					hour of trial - She was not only per- <lb />
					fectly conscious during this transaction <lb />
					but expressed also the enjoyment &amp; <lb />
					benefit she had derived from it.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					About 10 o&apos;cl. the same evening <lb />
					<add place="above">Jan 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> /55</add> whilst supported in the arms of some 
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
				
					the sisters the hour of her departure <lb />
					came; the silver cord was loosed, <lb />
					&amp; she gently breathed her last, her <lb />
					ransomed? spirit departing to be with <lb />
					that Lord whom she had long here <lb />
					followed in faith tho&apos; in feebleness &amp; <lb />
					<add place="above">with the sense of</add> much unperfection. <add place="above">Her age was 77 years.</add> May our <lb />
					end be as tranquil &amp; happy, &amp; as <lb />
					full of confidence in our unseen <lb />
					but present &amp; faithful Redeemer!  <lb />
