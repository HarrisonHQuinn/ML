						educated by my Parents, suitable for a Trademans Child, they were particularly attentive that I shoud not be seduc'd by the world. From my youngest Years I had a secret
						desire to please <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>, and to avoid every thing that was bad, this made me very attentive to the course of religious people, but my Fathers circumstances being upon the
						decline, I was (in order to avoid poverty) necessitated to go to Service, Thus I undertook a House-keepers place in a reputable family in the Country, where my Mistress
						faithfully instructed me in every thing she saw me deficient in, and among the rest, endeavour'd also to teach me true holiness, but my heart constantly convicted me that
						I was not right. Being now better qualify'd for a larger undertaking, I left this place in hopes of bettering my circumstances, and resolv'd for <placeName cert="high">London</placeName>, where I had
						two B<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in reputable business, I went thither by Sea with some acquaintances, but we had not been out a day before a violent storm arose, to that
						'twas expected we shou'd suffer Shipwreck, but that we might have our lives, it was resolv'd to take to the long boat, but I was determin'd rather to perish
						with the Ship, than venture in the boat, and leave my cloaths behind me, and thus suffer'd myself to be lock'd down in the Cabbin, laid myself on a Bed, never to
						behold this world any more, recomending my Soul to <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>, and for sometime put my hands over the bed side to feel if the water was approaching, then drop'd asleep. The Ship
						weather'd the storm, and the Captain return'd but how greatly was I supriz'd when with dificulty I was awoke, and found myself still in the Body, and all the
						vissisitudes of Life yet to go through. </p>

						House keepers place in this City, till I had first inform'd myself of what belong'd to such an undertaking, therefore took a House maids place in an eminent

						<hi rend="strikethrough">as</hi> I cou'd not join in their extravagant schemes and unfaithfulness to the prejudice of my good Master and Misstress, therefore without any

						but I resolv'd for <placeName cert="high">London</placeName> to get better advice, left my good place to the great distress of my worthy Master. In <placeName cert="high">London</placeName> I took to the Methodists contrary to the advice of

							<persName cert="high" type="real">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brook</persName> to tell her my situation of heart. She desir'd me to be comforted, for the <persName type="real" cert="high">Lord Jesus</persName> wou'd never have convinc'd me of
							<add place="above">my</add> sinfulness, but He wou'd also convince me where a true righteousness abounded, he had paid the ransom for all my sins thro' his Death
						and sufferings, and wou'd forgive me all if I cou'd but believe he suffer'd for my sake, and He woud make me happy thro' his merits without any works of
						mine, or any thing that any creature cou'd help me to, those were such words as I never heard before, that all my happiness consisted in believing in the <persName type="real" cert="high">Lord Jesus</persName>, all
						was to me as if an angel from Heaven had been conversing with me, I never know before that my Redeemer was the <persName type="real" cert="high">Lord Jesus Christ</persName>, she moreover told me that his grace wou'd

						involuntary <hi rend="strikethrough">crys</hi> Crys for the same Saviour to bless me, and in a moment, I was (as it were) seperated from all bodily sight of the Company, and
						saw nothing but my dear Saviour who stood ready to forgive me all my sins, shame and abasement seiz'd me so that I knew nothing what I said or did, my former unbelief and
						denial of all possibility of having my sins forgiven while in this Life brought me down into the dust, and I was inconsolable, and knew not how to accept such great grace,
						after such bold asertions of unbelief as I had made, my senses became more and more open'd to the great blessing our dear Saviour had bestowed upon me, but my friends
