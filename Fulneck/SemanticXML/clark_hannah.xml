							some time our Saviour Laid hold on her heart <lb />
							in Such a manner, that She had a great desier <lb />
							to be long to the Society, but being of a bashfull <lb />
							deposishon, She Could not say much for her <lb />
							self, thinking herself not worthy of Such a Saviou<add place="above">r</add> <lb />
							but being in Coragd by her S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> She howeve took <lb />
							Corage and was soon received into the Socity at <lb />
							Hallfax by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Horn; in ye year 48 She came to <lb />
							Live at Cloketon EOconemy where She <del>Coul</del> was <lb />

								the S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Askd her <lb />
							why She was in such a hury to go to grace hall, the day that <lb />
							She was Recived, She being alway usd to be one of the <lb />
							Last, O said she I had some thing in my mind, I thought <lb />
							perhaps I Shall be recievd therefore I did not Like <lb />
							to be to Late, I had a feeling of it but, I did not Like <lb />
							to tell any body of it, When the Sisters Enterd the <lb />
							Choir-hous She with Some others was orderd to Live <lb />
							in pudsey Town, which grived her very much, and <lb />
							She said, She Cou&apos;d not reast till She Came to Live <lb />
							in the Choir-hous, July y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 53 She became a <lb />

							year She was Confirmd, and Dec<hi rend="superscript">ber</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> She pertook of <lb />
							the holy Sacrament, for the first time; this provd <del>with</del> a <lb />
							great bless to her, from this time forward she grew <lb />
							much more Lively and Chearfull then ever, She had <lb />
							been before, once as She was going to the Meeting She <lb />
							fell and hurt her knee, her Father being a Dacter She <lb />
							went to Stay there a while, to see if she Could be Cur&apos;d <lb />
							but While She was there, She was much dissatisfid <lb />
							and wanted to be at home again, in the Mean time the <lb />
							Pudsey EOconemy Came to live in the Choir-hous her S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
							Going to see her, She Askd her if they was moved, She <lb />

							that her bed was in <add place="above">the</add> sleep-hall, this rejoiced her <lb />
							Very much and She said I am Satisfied if I only <lb />
							have the faviour to be in the Hous, She Coud not <lb />
							be Satisfied to stay any Longer with her father <lb />
							but hastend to come home, and enterd her Choir <lb />
							house with much pleasuer; ever since She got that <lb />
							hurt in her knee, She has been Sickley, So that on <lb />
							could planly see that she was in a declining way <lb />
							<del>Since that time nothing,</del> during this her Sickness nothing <lb />
							has hapend to destirb her in her Couers of grace but <lb />
							She has gone on in a simple, and Child Manner, About <lb />
							Christmas 55 She got a bad Cough, and it seem&apos;d as if <lb />
							it wou&apos;d turn to a Cunsumtion, Last jan<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> her S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> went <lb />
							to visit her father, She Ask her what She Shoud Say to <lb />
							him about her, She said I have not much for fisik at <lb />
							present, perhaps byenby I Shall want it more then <lb />
							now, She was very Still and Complaind but Little <lb />
							but when She by degrees grew wors, She had <add place="above">a</add> mind <lb />
							to try if enything Could be of servis to her, She <lb />
							then Sent to her father but he Said it wou&apos;d be to no <lb />
							perpos however She took something which gave <lb />
							her Eas&apos; for a short time, but however it was very deserna- <lb />
							ble, that her End drew near, this She belived herself <lb />
							and at first She took it very Near to heart; that <lb />
							She hat not Spent her time in such a tender, Connecttion <lb />
							with the man of Sorrows as She Could have wich&apos;d <lb />
							She spoke of it to her Sister, but however, said She <lb />
							He: Loves me dearly, and has patiene with me; about <lb />
							the middle of June, She took to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sick-room, when <lb />
							She was Ask&apos;d if She Shoud not Like to, be well again <lb />
							She answerd No! I will rather go to our Saviour, wile <lb />
							She was in the Sick-room, She went once it to the <lb />
							hall to the holy Sacrament, when She came home <lb />
							again, She was so ill that we thought She would have gone <lb />
							directl; but in a little time She recoverd again; when she <lb />
							Said I am acceding glad that I have enjoy&apos;d it once more <lb />
							with the Congregation, for it is the Last time, She <lb />
							was exceeding Light and Chearfull, and said I Can&apos;t <lb />
							Express in words, what I have enjoid by the holy <lb />
							Sacrament my heart is So refreachd that it has made <lb />
							me quit Strong, yet my Longing and desier is to go to him <lb />
							who has done so much for me, O I wish that that happier <lb />
							time may soon Come, She was thro&apos; her whole sickness
					</p>
					<cb/>
					<p>
							Exceeing <gap reason="illegible"/> patient and when Any one told her that <lb />
							She Lookd very ill O said she I am to be ill, but it is no <lb />
							matter; will bear it as well as I Can, it will soon be over <lb />
							then I shall be quit well,</p>
					<p>
							About a Month ago her Class Sisters gave her a fair- <lb />
							well Love-feast at which She was very much delighted <lb />
							this was the Last time of her Comeing out of the Sickroom <lb />
							When She was spoke to for the Sacrament the Last <lb />
							time, She Express'd, her Longing desier for it, O Said <lb />
							She I would gladly have been with our Saviour before; <lb />
							this time it will however be the Last, I Shall now soon be <lb />
							with our Saviour; the fourth of this month, She pertook <lb />
							of the holy Sacrament, with such A longing and <lb />
							Eager heart, that She Cou&apos;d Scarely wait till the <lb />
							time Came, when She got the bread into her hands it <lb />
							Cant be express&apos;d in words, how Eger she was, as <lb />
							also when she took the Cup, it seemt as tho&apos; She <lb />
							thought it was the Last time that I shall enjoy it here <lb />
							I will now take my fill, A few day before her Departure <lb />
							her Cough Stop&apos;d and She grew weaker, the Night <lb />
							before her departuer She keept a very hearty band <lb />
							with the Sister who watchd with her, and thank&apos;d <lb />
							her for all that which She had don for her, She now <lb />
							alterd and one Coud see that her hour of Departuer <lb />
							Drew Nigh, She Calld out very often for our Saviour <lb />
							to fetch her, and <add place="above">not</add> to Let her Stay to Long here, She <lb />
							wou&apos;d often Stretch out her Arme as if She Catchd at <lb />
							something, saying O he is my dear Saviour He is my <lb />
							dear Saviour, O Come my dearst Lamb, Come to <lb />
							fetch me, take me into thy Armes, then She said <lb />
							to her S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Now I am satisfied, She said with wat art thou <lb />
							Satisfied? She answerd with our Saviour he Lets me <lb />
							fell his tender heart, and how much he loves me, ten <lb />
							times more then I Could expect? She then feeling her <lb />
							Self just redy for going, She sent for S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Dorgy, She <lb />
							thinking them not quick enough, Crid out pray Come
							soon</p>
					<p>
							When thay Came they began to Sing some Verses <lb />
							Sutiable there to, but She however Recoverd again <lb />
							and Lay quit still only Desiering the Sisters <lb />
