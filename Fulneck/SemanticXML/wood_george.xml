							Personalia of the <roleName type="honorific">single B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> <persName ref="#mlper000543" cert="high" type="real">George Wood</persName>, who in his sick room <lb/>
							left the following Acc<hi rend="superscript">t </hi>of himself.						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						I was born at <placeName ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Holbeck" key="Holbeck" cert="high">Holbeck</placeName> in the <placeName ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q39121" key="Leeds" sameAs="#mlpla000050" cert="high">Parish of Leeds</placeName> <date when="1735-08-25" cert="high">August 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1735</date>. <lb/>
						My Father was a native of <placeName ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland" key="Ireland" cert="high">Ireland</placeName> &amp; my Mother a <placeName ref="#mlpla000084" key="Yorkshire" sameAs="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q163" cert="high">Yorkshire</placeName> Woman. <lb/>
						When I was about 2 years old my Father left my Mother to Care <lb/>
						for herself &amp; Children &amp; went into <placeName ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland" key="Ireland" cert="high">Ireland</placeName>. My Mother brought <lb/>
						me up as well as she could, but on Account of Poverly was not <lb/>
						able to give me any Schooling, the Loss of which I have experienced <lb/>
						the most since I come amongst the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi></orgName> ; for as I had not learn'd to  <lb/>
						read, I was deprived of that Opportunity which my <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> f</orgName> have, of <lb/>
						entertaining themselves, with reading something agreeable about <lb/>
						our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, in their sabbatic Hours: But this Loss has been suffic <lb/> ciently restored by our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> in granting me his precious <lb/>
							Nearness, whenever I wept for him!
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						In my Youngest Years, I was a Child of a quiet Disposition, <lb/>
						and liked best to be alone because when I happened to come into <lb/>
						the Company of other Children, something generally occurred <lb/>
						about which my Mind was uneasy afterwards, I therefore kept <lb/>
						chiefly <hi rend="superscript">by</hi> to myself &amp; often took a Walk alone, feeling my Mind <lb/>
							most easy and chearful in this Course.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						In my 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year, I was put apprentice to my Uncle Stancliff <lb/>
						who was then amongst the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>, to be a Clothier &amp; the first Sunday <lb/>
						he took me with him to Grace Hall, on which Day I felt something <lb/>
							powerful in my Heart from our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>., What I heard &amp; felt had
						such an Effect that I could not miss one Meeting afterwards <lb/>
						to which I was allowed the Priviledge of going. I soon got acquainted with dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Held, who gave me Leave to go to all the <lb/>
						Childrens Meetings, Bands &amp; Classes, which proved a real Blessing <lb/>
						to my Heart. "When I was about 14 Years old I was rec<hi rend="superscript">d </hi>amongst <lb/>
						the great Boys by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charlesworth from which Time I attended <lb/>
						the Boys Meetings diligently &amp; with Pleasure not obtaining any <lb/>
						Thing particular in Mind or Body to what I had done in my <lb/>
						Childrens Years, but felt our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> near my Heart, &amp; was well <lb/>
						in the Meetings of the Boys; yet during all this time tho' I felt <lb/>
						very well, I had not a real &amp; solid Connexion &amp; Conversation <lb/>
						with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> as a Sinner, which afterwards was made clear to me. <lb/>
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							In any 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year I begun to perceive my natural Depravity and

						Corruption pretty strongly, promting me to things which I know very <lb/>
						well were against the Mind, <del>of</del> &amp; Heart of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, but has <add place="above">not</add> sufficient <lb/>
						acquaintance with Him &amp; Foundation in my own Heart to make the <lb/>
						right Use of him in these new Circumstances, &amp; was therefore brought <lb/>
						into Darkness &amp; great Perplexity of Mind, so that I was sometimes <lb/>
						very dubious how it would at last End with me, yet <del>the</del> in the <lb/>
						bottom of my Heart I had a real desire to be helped into a happy <lb/>
						clear Track but my greatest Misfortune was a false shame, which <lb/>
						caused me to conceal <del>the</del> my true Condition &amp; the Cause of my Differences <lb/>
						from my labourers, but being frequently visited <del>by</del> at that time <lb/>
						by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Renatus, he perceived I was not so clear &amp; lively as usual &amp; <lb/>
						wanted to know the cause, but which I avoided telling, till I could <lb/>
						hold out no longer, being compelled by the great Misery of my Heart <lb/>
						to disclose every thing wherewith I was bound &amp; entangled, &amp; which <lb/>
						indeed proved very happy for me in its Consequences. I then could <lb/>
						&amp; did speak with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> in a sinnerlike, confident Manner, &amp; often <lb/>
						times fell on my Face before <add place="above">him</add> &amp; wept bitterly, till He melted my <lb/>
						Heart with his Nearness &amp; rich Forgiveness, &amp; cheared me with his <lb/>
						friendly look. I then resolved to devote my Soul &amp; Body just as <lb/>
						it was to him, &amp; to speak quite openheartedly with my Labourers <lb/>
						about all my Circumstances for I felt the sweets of it, &amp; since I <lb/>
						made that Resolution it has been my constant practice to my <lb/>
						surprising ease &amp; Blessing. From this time, I have had a happy Con: <lb/>
						nexion with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, I went every Night into the Fields after I <lb/>
						had done work to speak with the Friend of my Soul, whom incom  <lb/>
						parable Nearness &amp; presence always met me, so that my Eyes &amp; Heart <lb/>
						were often overflowing with gratitude, on Account of what he had <lb/>
						done for &amp; manifested to me. My concern about the Preservation <lb/>
						of my Soul &amp; body was often the Subject of my Conversation with Him <lb/>
						&amp; therefore I pray'd him with Tears to make a Way for me to the Choir House <lb/>
						for I felt no place else in all the world could satisfy me. Some Weeks, <lb/>
						after I was loose of my Apprenticeship, I had the Joyfull <lb/>
						News brought me that our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had given me Leave to come I live <lb/>
						in the Choir House which Grace I accepted of with thousand thanks <lb/>
						to my dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, who thus graciously heard &amp; granted my Request <lb/>
							&amp; soon after I came with Joy &amp; gratitude of heart into my beloved

						same year had the Grace to be rec'<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to my inexpressible <lb/>
						Joy, and went the first Fine to the holy Communion with my clear Single <lb/>
						B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at a Choir Communion June 11<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1757 whereby my highest Wish <lb/>
						next to that of seeing &amp; embracing him bodily was granted me, &amp; <lb/>

						one of my Feet &amp; broke out in a running Ulcer whereby I was <lb/>
						incapable of earning my bread for a long Time. I made Use of <lb/>
						many things &amp; also by Advice went to the how, not without long <lb/>
						&amp;effect the areal here was not wrought by any thing I tried of <lb/>

						kissing the Points in Hands and feet for my Grace Election <lb/>
						I wait in my Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Hands &amp; Friendship with ardent Desire <lb/>
						the happy End of all Complaint when I shall grow pallid <lb/>
							in Jesus Arms &amp; Lap."</p> 
					<p>So far his own account.</p>
					<p>
						
						To which we will only add, that his course amongst us from <lb/>
						first to last has been as a <add place="above">youth</add> of God, solid, steady &amp; annointed. <lb/>
						and his Heart past has <del>has</del> lived in a tender uninterrupted connexion <lb/>
						with the Man of Sorrows, so that it was always a pleasure to keep Band <lb/>
						with him. We kept his Hearts object constantly in View &amp; suffered <lb/>
						nothing to disturb him in the Enjoyment thereof, so that we have <lb/>
						had no Grief, but always Joy over him, &amp; some Years <add place="above">since</add> when the <lb/>
							<add place="above">situation of</add>
								<del>it looked precarious with</del> many of our young Single B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>
						<add place="above">seemed very precarious</add> he was <lb/>
						not in the least disturbed thereby in his happy Track, but cleaved <lb/>
						the more closely to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; was heartily glad of &amp; thankful <lb/>
							for his election.

						<add place="above">His</add> Sickness would not <add place="above">From the time that</add> permit him to weave <lb/>
						<del>work</del> any longer <del>at</del> he busied himself with such little <lb/>
						Matters as he could do in the House &amp; which he did with Faithfulness <lb/>
						&amp; Pleasure as long as he could, &amp; till he betook himself entering  <lb/>
						to the Sick Room. Here he enjoyd a perfect Sabbath in the Nearness <lb/>
						of his bleeding Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. It was a Pleasure to visit him &amp; speak with <lb/>
						him abt. our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. He never liked to hear any thing about his reco- <lb/>
						very but wish'd <add place="above">that</add> his happy Hour <add place="above">might soon</add> strike. He was patient in his Sickness <lb/>
							to Admonition for said he, our Savr's Nearness makes my Sickness tolerable &amp; Happy.

						&amp; <add place="above">was</add> thankful to his Brn, as also to to his Sick Waiters for every Thing he <lb/>
							enjoyed. <del>At</del> the last <add place="above">time he was spoken with</add>
						<del>Speaking</del> before the Communion he said I think  <lb/>
						this will be the last Time I <add place="above">shall</add> enjoy His Corpse Blood here &amp; when  <lb/>
						it was brought to him he enjoyd it with great Devotion &amp; a particular <lb/>
							aweful Feeling attended it.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
						The 2 last times he Class was kept he decided it might be in his  <lb/>
						Sick Room, which was granted. he told his Class B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> that his longing  <lb/>
						to be with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was the only Concern he now had and entreated <lb/>
						them to beg our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to hear him soon. Feb 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> he was so very <lb/>
						weak that we expected him soon to go Home. His Heart's Situation and <lb/>
						Longing to go home was charming and pretty: Love verses were sung <lb/>
						for him &amp; tho he could speak no more yet he gave signs with a  <lb/>
						most lovely childlike Aspect &amp; said at the end of every Verse, moor. <lb/>
						Feb the 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> betwixt 3 &amp; 4 in the Morning he called to his Sick Waiter <lb/>
						&amp; wanted to get up. Upon being ask'd Why? he answered, "I am not <lb/>
						yet at Home, I want to go home to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>." He was told that <lb/>
						our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> would soon come &amp; take him to himself which he  <lb/>
						was <add place="above">much</add> pleased to be assured of, &amp; thus he continued quite unfit <lb/>
						to his last Moment when about 8 o'Clock his Friend beckon'd <lb/>
						to him, &amp; he grew pale in Arms &amp; Legs wiht the Blessing <lb/>
						of his Choir during the singing the Word "And now his  <lb/>
						Mouth expiring on thy dear Breast recline &amp;c and with  <lb/>
						these fine Tents, <hi rend="underline">The Sparrow hath found an House, and  <lb/>
							the Swallow a Nest.</hi> lit: Tent. <hi rend="underline">With my Spirit within me <lb/>
								I seek thee early. My Saviour, Ah! was I with Thee.</hi> <lb/>
						The Feeling attending his Separture was inexpressible, &amp; <lb/>
						caused the Eyes of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn </hi>presant to overflow, our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb/>
						was indeed there tho our Eyes could not see Him yet the <lb/>
							Feeling testified it sufficiently.
