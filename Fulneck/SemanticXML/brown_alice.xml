					<p> in the Same Year there was begun an Oconemy of Sisters at Duckenfield, were She with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>rest of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters Lived very
						happly </p>
					<p> in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>year 50. She with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>reast of the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> removed to Yorkshire And She same into y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Oconemy in Lambs hill, were she lived as a Chearfull, and Sinnerlike heart, thankfull, for her happy lot of grace to be so closly, United with our
						Saviours Congregation, which She pris'd very highly </p>
					<p> When y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Hundred, was Setled here, She was one which was recived into that Number </p>
					<p> In y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Year 1753 She removed in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Choir-house with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>rest of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters, at which She rejoiced, very much, for y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Liveing in a Choir-house, was to her every waty matter, for her Choir was very dear to her,
						and one can with trueth, Give her y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>testimony, that She was a true Virgin, who went on in an uninterrupted Convers with ye Man of Smart, being
						tenderly attached to his Marterd figur, </p>
					<p> She enjoid, in her Choir, all Choir Graces, And when ye Dear Mother, and Dicipl was here, at that Never to be forgotten blessed Choier, Lord-supper; She was also one of that
						Number for this Long time past, She has talkd very much of going home And said She, <add place="above">I can't</add> not help beliveing that <add place="above">my</add>
						time would not be long in this World, on her last birth-day She got a particular intimation from our Saviour, Consorneing thiss, since which time, She has often told y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sister you will <add place="above">see</add>, I shall go home before my next birth-day, for I have beg'd our Saviour to take me home thiss

						year and I also belive he surely will, She has for some time past, Complaind very much of a pain in her head which never Left her, but continued to grow worse, and tis
						Strenthend her belive, that she should soon be with our Saviour </p>
					<p> On July y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> She enterd y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sick room, when y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>disorder in her
						head, began to grow very Voilen, </p>
					<p> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> She began to Sing, have no mind for Eating or for drinking Food, which must Corrupt again &amp;c And many such
						like Versses, which showd planly the Longing of her heart to be at home; altho her pains which she felt, was very great yet when She recoverd, her Self a little, She was so
						brisk and Chearfull and would talk with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters in Such on agreable manner, that it was a pleasuer, to be with her <add place="above">her</add>

						disorder lying so much in her head, we thought it proper to keep her still as possable, it was there for desired that y<hi rend="superscript">e </hi>Sister would go but of
						Little in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sick-room, which when She percived, made her very much </p>
					<cb></cb>
					<p> dissatisfied, and She desired that y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters might not be kept from comeing to see her, becose it made the time much pleasent'er to her when

							y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters was with her. </p>
					<p> She desired that She might once <add place="above">more</add> be brought into her Liveing Room, which was done, this pleasd her very much, She desired we would Sing her some
						Verses, for going home, which was done under such a sencable felling, of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Nearness of our Saviour, and with an inward loning of our hearts, to be
						at home with him; which made our Eyes over flow with tears, we could scarcely perswade her to let us take her in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sick-room again, but being

						affraid She would spend her self to and we beg'<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> her Now to take her Leave, then She desired us to concluded, with that Vers, Love, who death
						for me endured, &amp;c. </p>
					<p> in a few days after, She desired to see her Class, once more together When y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters had made y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Love-feast ready they
						brought her into y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Room, at which She was so lively and Chearfull, that She did not seem like a Sick-person; so that we Could have almost belive,
						She might rely recover again; we put it to her, if She Still realy thought of Leveing us; She said, She could not tell, but her Choice, wou'd be to go home, but when I
						consider it rightly, what A time that will be, when I come to our Saviour, the favour seems to great; we then Askd her, if She did go home whome She would fetch y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>first She then Namd a Sister, we then Ask'd why her in perticuler? She <add place="above">said</add> becose I belive She will be y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>first of this company And then we will fetch all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>rest, one after a nother; I have often told you that when I come to
						our Saviour, I will not forget one in this house, this She took leve of her Class, and went again in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sick-room She continued for some time,
						better then ever we had seen, her since in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sick-room, so that She her Self, began to believe, She might mend again, but in a short time, her pain
						returnd rather worse then ever, </p>
					<p> On y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>8 of Aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> She got a fainting fit, we us'd mens to bring her to her Self again, when She Opend her Eyes and
						saw y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Sisters, She Smild, and said, Ay! are you come to Lay me out, why did you not let me go, if you had let me a Lone, and had not disturbed I
						shou'd have gon quit softly away </p>

					<p>
						<del>On y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>15th She sent for Sister mary, as she wanted to Settel some</del>
						<del>matters with, Consorneing her Burial</del>
					</p>
					<p> On y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of August She for y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>last time pertook of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi>Corpess And

					<p> it seemd as if She thought of going soon, but we percived No alteration in her; for <del>the</del> several <add place="above">day</add> She has not been able to take any thing
						to Signiss; but as we saw no ferther alterration in her; we little thought of her dissolution, being so nigh as it rely was, for She was unobservedly hasten to give her
