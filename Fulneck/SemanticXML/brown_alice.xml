					Our Dear Departed S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alice Brown; was borne at Ashton <lb/>
					in Lancashire, on April ye 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> in ye year 1730 
				
			</p>
			<p>
				
					from a child She was never without Convictions, and as soon y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
					Brethren came to Duckenfield, She was one y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> &amp; first Children wich was <lb/>
					takes under y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> care, y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> tender Longing of her heart is become truly acquaintd <lb/>
					with our Saviour, <add place="above">and</add> to know for her own individual; her Grace of Election in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
					Wounds of Jesus, was plainly felt and seen in all his Actions; She Us&apos;d <lb/>
					often to go alone by her Self, in to <add place="above">the</add> fields, and when she Could get in to a <lb/>
					privet place prostrated her self on y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> ground, before our Saviour, beging him <lb/>
					for his Death and Bloods Sake, to bestow upon her, that happiness, and <lb/>
					full pardon in his Wounds, which she felt, as belived was to be attain'd <lb/>
					to; even wile in this Body, in this sittuation She went on, till she had obtain'd <lb/>
					what her heart wanted; of this blest course of Grace, which our Saviour <lb/>
					begun with her wile a Child; She Us&apos;d afterwards to relate with <lb/>
					plesuer; and it always came from her with such a tender felling, that  <lb/>
					Who ever heard her speak thereof Could not but be Sencably back&apos;d, <lb/>
					In y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Year 1744  She left her Parents, and lived with her three <lb/>
					Brothers and two Sisters, Who on account of their Mother, being <lb/>
					at that time of a different way of thinking from them, had taken a <lb/>
					house them Selves; in order to follow their Course with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Brethren <lb/>
					more to their own Satisfaction, she lived thus about half a year <lb/>
					and then she with her two Sister, and a few more, made y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> begining <lb/>
					of a little Oeconomy, which lasted about a year and half, when on some <lb/>
					Ocations, it was thought fit for that House-keeping to be broke up, <lb/>
					And such had <add place="above">it</add> propos&apos;d to them, to go to their homes again, <lb/>
					This proved a great grife, to our depated Sister, and She with her Christ <lb/>
					Sister Resolve&apos;d not to go back to their parents, but to live together <lb/>
					till our Saviour Should see fit to make out some way for them, which <lb/>
					Accordingly happen&apos;d, that very year, When Brother, and Sister <lb/>
					Hackenwelter came thither, Who Approved him self as a faithful <lb/>
					Father in helping y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters, as far as lay in his Power, and Capability <lb/>
					our Departed Sister; whome they Look&apos;d upon as their own Child in all <lb/>
					this time, our Saviour carried on <add place="above">his</add> Worke of Grace in her heart, in a manner <lb/>
					not to be discribed, but which at y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> same time was very Decernable to all <lb/>
					who knew her, 
				
			</p>
			<p>
				
					April y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 23<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1748 She was Recived in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Congregation, <lb/>
					and on Aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> same year She was made a partaker of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
					Corpess and blood of Jesus; in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> holy Sacrament, <lb/>
					Altho&apos; she was Naturaly of a very still disposition, yet Concerning <lb/>
					her own heart, and y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Acquaintens with our Saviour She Cou&apos;d say enouf: <lb/>
					for, as soon as any one, begun in this subject, She never was Silent <lb/>
					but was always ready to relate, our Saviours works of Grace in her heart <lb/>
					Which from time to time, through his most Nearness, was carried on in her <lb/>
					further then any Human Eye could penatrate, and past (unclear) <lb/>
					so that when She in a Childlike manner spoke something thereof it made <lb/>
					her fellow Sisters mealt in (unclear) Shame,

					in the Same Year there was begun an Oconemy of Sisters at <lb/>
					Duckenfield, were She with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> rest of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters Lived very happly 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> year 50. She with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> reast of the Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> removed to York-shire <lb/>
					And She same into y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Oconemy in Lambs hill, were she lived as a  <lb/>
					Chearfull, and Sinnerlike heart, thankfull, for her happy lot of grace <lb/>
					to be so closly, United with our Saviours Congregation, which She <lb/>
					pris&apos;d very highly
			</p>
			<p>
				
					When y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Hundred, was Setled here, She was one which was recived into <lb/>
					that Number 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					I y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Year 1753 She removed in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Choir-house with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> rest <lb/>
					of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters, at which She rejoiced, very much, for y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Liveing in a <lb/>
					Choir-house, was to her every waty matter, for her Choir was very dear <lb/>
					to her, and one can with trueth, Give her y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> testimony, that She was <lb/>
					a true Virgin, who went on in an uninterrupted Convers with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
					Man of Smart, being tenderly attached to his Marterd figur, 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					She enjoid, in her Choir, all Choir Graces, And when y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
					Dear Mother, and Dicipl was here, at that Never to be forgotten <lb/>
					blessed Choier, Lord-supper; She was also one of that Number <lb/>
					for this Long time past, She has talkd very much of going home <lb/>
					And said She, <add place="above">I can&apos;t</add> not help beliveing that <add place="above">my</add> time would not <lb/>
					be long in this World, on her last birth-day She got a particular <lb/>
					intimation from our Saviour, Consorneing thiss, since which <lb/>
					time, She has often told y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sister you will <add place="above">see</add>, I shall go home before <lb/>
					my next birth-day, for I have beg&apos;d our Saviour to take me <lb/>
					home thiss year and I also belive he surely will, She has for <lb/>
					some time past, Complaind very much of a pain in her head <lb/>
					which never Left her, but continued to grow worse, and tis <lb/>
					Strenthend her belive, that she should soon be with our Saviour 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					On July y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> She enterd y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sick room, when y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> disorder in <lb/>
					her head, began to grow very Voilen, 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					ye 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> She began to Sing, have no mind for Eating or for drinking <lb/>
					Food, which must Corrupt again &amp;c <lb/>
					And many such like Versses, which showd planly the Longing of her <lb/>
					heart to be at home; altho her pains which she felt, was very great <lb/>
					yet when She recoverd, her Self a little, She was so brisk and Chearfull <lb/>
					and would talk with y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters in Such on agreable manner, that <lb/>
					it was a pleasuer, to be with her <add place="above">her</add> disorder lying so much in her <lb/>
					head, we thought it proper to keep her still as possable, it was there for <lb/>
					desired that y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sister would go but of Little in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
					Sick-room, which when She percived, made her very much 
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
				
					dissatisfied, and She desired that y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters might not <lb/>
					be kept from comeing to see her, becose it made the time much <lb/>
					pleasent&apos;er to her when y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters was with her. 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					She desired that She might once <add place="above">more</add> be brought into her Liveing <lb/>
					Room, which was done, this pleasd her very much, She desired we would <lb/>
					Sing her some Verses, for going home, which was done under such a <lb/>
					sencable felling, of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Nearness of our Saviour, and with an inward <lb/>
					loning of our hearts, to be at home with him; which made our Eyes over flow <lb/>
					with tears, we could scarcely perswade her to let us take her in to <lb/>
					ye Sick-room again, but being affraid She would spend her self to <lb/>
					and we beg&apos;<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> her Now to take her Leave, then She desired us to <lb/>
					concluded, with that Vers, Love, who death for me endured, &amp;c.
			</p>
			<p>
				
					in a few days after, She desired to see her Class, once more together <lb/>
					When y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sisters had made y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Love-feast ready they brought her <lb/>
					into y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Room, at which She was so lively and Chearfull, that She <lb/>
					did not seem like a Sick-person; so that we Could have almost <lb/>
					belive, She might rely recover again; we put it to her, if She Still <lb/>
					realy thought of Leveing us; She said, She could not tell, but her <lb/>
					Choice, wou&apos;d be to go home, but when I consider it rightly, what <lb/>
					A time that will be, when I come to our Saviour, the favour seems <lb/>
					to great; we then Askd her, if She did go home whome She would <lb/>
					fetch y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> first She then Namd a Sister, we then Ask&apos;d why her in <lb/>
					perticuler? She <add place="above">said</add> becose I belive She will be y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> first of this company <lb/>
					And then we will fetch all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> rest, one after a nother; I have often told <lb/>
					you that when I come to our Saviour, I will not forget one in this house, <lb/>
					this She took leve of her Class, and went again in to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sick-room <lb/>
					She continued for some time, better then ever we had seen, her since <lb/>
					in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Sick-room, so that She her Self, began to believe, She might <lb/>
					mend again, but in a short time, her pain returnd rather worse <lb/>
					then ever, 
			</p>
			<p>
				
					On y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> 8 of Aug<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> She got a fainting fit, we us&apos;d mens to bring her <lb/>
