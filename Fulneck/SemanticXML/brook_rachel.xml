					Our late Sr Rachel Brook was  <lb />
					born Apr. 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1744 at Birstol. <lb />
					Her Parents, who loved the Lord <lb />
					directed her from her earliest <lb />
					years to the friend of Children  <lb />
					and took her, when a Child to the <lb />
					Chaple at Gumersal, where she at <lb />
					tended the Childrens meetings, and  <lb />
					and used to be delighted to hear <lb />
					of our Saviours love, and when <lb />
					comming home she would some <lb />
					time kneel down in a corner <lb />
					and pray to him to bless her <lb />
					and form her to his mind. <lb /></p>
					<p>
					<del>But</del> When she grew older she found <lb />
					that tender Childlike love to our  <lb />
					growing cold, she wished to injoy <lb />
					the world, and its vain pleasured, <lb />
					but always felt a monitor within, <lb />
					warning her from going the broad <lb />
					road, which leadeth to destruction; <lb />
					she spent some time in great <lb />
						<note type="catchword">trouble</note> <lb />

					trouble of mind, not willing to <lb />
					follow the Lord, and full of fear <lb />
					to be last eternally; during this <lb />
					period, which was in her 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
					year, she had a very remarkable <lb />
					dream: it was to her as if she  <lb />
					saw our Saviour on the Cross, in <lb />
					the most lovely attitude, saying <lb />
					to her, &quot;all my sufferings, wounds <lb />
					and bruises were for thee, to <lb />
					save and redeem thy sinful soul.&quot; <lb />
					This made a deep impression on her <lb />
					mind, and she turned in earnest <lb />
					prayer to the Lord, that he would <lb />
					pardon her sins and transgressions <lb />
					and renew a right spirit within <lb />
					her, &amp; once when walking in a field <lb />
					by herself, with tears and prayer <lb />
					lifting up her hands to him, she <lb />
					got an assurance that her guilt <lb />
					should be done away, and that <lb />
					he would prove her good Shepherd <lb />
					<note type="catchword">who</note> <lb />

					who seeks that which was lost <lb />
					with unwearied faithfulness. <lb />
					This has followed <add place="above">her</add> all her life and  <lb />
					often thro&apos; grace been renewed. <lb /></p>
						<p>
					She now felt a desire to be closer <lb />
					united with the Brns Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and  <lb />
					to injoy the priviliges of the same. <lb />
					Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760 she moved into the <lb />
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House here in Fulnek, May 11. <lb />
					1761 she was recd into the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb />
					and May 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the following year <lb />
					partook for the first time of <lb />
					the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. She often spoke <lb />
					with great pleasure, of the time <lb />
					of her first com<del>m</del>ing, how happy <lb />
					she was in communion with our <lb />
					Saviour, and how comfortable the <lb />
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> were together in the so called <lb />
					spinning days, and how they delighted <lb />
					midst great poverty in singing the <lb />
					praises of the Lord. She was <lb />
					soon impolyed in serving as an Over <lb />

					seer with the Girls, and afterwards <lb />
					with Sisters. In 1790 she was accepted  <lb />
					atcoluth, and for 18 years she held <lb />
					the Office of Houseservant, she  <lb />
					showed much faithfulness in what <lb />
					was committed to her, and looked <lb />
					opon it as a favour, which <lb />
					made her Office a pleasant duty. <lb />
					<del>to her.</del> The last few years, she <lb />
					was not able to do as formerly <lb />
					but injoying the love of the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb />
					they were willing to lend her a <lb />
					helping hand whenever required, <lb />
					particularly those S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in her room <lb />
					showed her much love &amp; attention. <lb />
					Tho&apos; nothing very striking seemed to <lb />
					distinguish her course, we are sure <lb />
					that she lived in communion with <lb />
					our Saviour, and with Childlike <lb />
					confidence and humble faith looked <lb />
					to him for help and support in <lb />
					every time of need.  <lb />

					Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1810 she called to mind that <lb />
					it was 50 years since she moved <lb />
					into this house, she expressed <lb />
					herself that she could not suffi- <lb />
					ciently thank our Saviour, for all <lb />
					his love and care, his longsuffering <lb />
					and forbearance, and for all his  <lb />
					mercy towards her, and looked back <lb />
					with gratitude and amazement how <lb />
					he had proved her true friends in <lb />
					all her spiritual and temporal <lb />
					concerns, that she had laked <lb />
					nothing; and she renewed her  <lb />
					convenant to cleave to him, to  <lb />
					trust his Shepherd care, till <lb />
					hope and faith shall cease, and <lb />
					Love prevail alone. </p>
							<p>
					Hitherto she had injoyed an unin- <lb />
					terrupted good stale of health, but <lb />
					now she began to feel the infir- <lb />
					mities of age, and for these last 3 <lb />
					years, she was not able to attend

					the meetings as she used to do, <lb />
					which was a great trial to her. </p>
						<p>
					She was however able to go about <lb />
					in the house, tho&apos; at last with <lb />
					great difficulty, till the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
					of this month, when she had to  <lb />
					be confined to the sickroom, her <lb />
					weakness increased rapidly; tho&apos; <lb />
					she did not think that her de- <lb />
					parture was so near, she felt <lb />
					resigned to our Saviours will, <lb />
					saying: &quot;My times are in his hands <lb />
					"I can <del>say</del> do nothing but pray <lb />
					"to him to receive me, a poor <lb />
					"and worthless sinner, in mercy, <lb />
					"and I am sure he will.&quot; - </p>
						<p>
					On the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she called to mind the <lb />
					blessings she had often enjoyed on <lb />
					that great memorial day, and  <lb />
					particularly what she had felt the <lb />
					first time, when she celebrated it <lb />
					55 years ago, during the singing of <lb />
					that verse: <lb />

					<l>O Church, how many hast thou yet</l>
					<l>Who do not love the Saviour?</l>
					<l>Who do not think his burden light</l>
					<l>Nor his sweet Yoke a favour!</l>
					<l>O ye, who don&apos;t stand well with him,</l>
					<l>Do ye long for redemption?</l></lg>
				<lg type="verse">
					<l>Now, now, is for you the right time</l>
					<l>Come all without exception.</l>
					<l>She spent the following days mostly</l>
					<l>in a slumber, and when she awoke</l>
					<l>between, <del>she</del> only complained on </l>
					<l>great weakness, she often folded</l>
					<l>her hands, as being ingaged in</l>
					<l>prayers, when the lipps no more</l>
					<l>could say; and on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it </l>
					<l>pleased the Lord to call her to </l>
					<l>himself in a gentle and happy</l>
