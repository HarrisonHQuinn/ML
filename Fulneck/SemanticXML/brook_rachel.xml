					Our late Sr Rachel Brook was  <lb/>
					born <date when="1744-04-28" cert="high">Apr. 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1744</date> at Birstol. <lb/>
					Her Parents, who loved the Lord <lb/>
					directed her from her earliest <lb/>
					years to the friend of Children  <lb/>
					and took her, when a Child to the <lb/>
					Chaple at Gumersal, where she at <lb/>
					tended the Childrens meetings, and  <lb/>
					and used to be delighted to hear <lb/>
					of our Saviours love, and when <lb/>
					comming home she would some <lb/>
					time kneel down in a corner <lb/>
					and pray to him to bless her <lb/>
					and form her to his mind. <lb/></p>
					<p>
					<del>But</del> When she grew older she found <lb/>
					that tender Childlike love to our  <lb/>
					growing cold, she wished to injoy <lb/>
					the world, and its vain pleasured, <lb/>
					but always felt a monitor within, <lb/>
					warning her from going the broad <lb/>
					road, which leadeth to destruction; <lb/>
					she spent some time in great <lb/>
						<note type="catchword">trouble</note> <lb/>

					trouble of mind, not willing to <lb/>
					follow the Lord, and full of fear <lb/>
					to be last eternally; during this <lb/>
					period, which was in her 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb/>
					year, she had a very remarkable <lb/>
					dream: it was to her as if she  <lb/>
					saw our Saviour on the Cross, in <lb/>
					the most lovely attitude, saying <lb/>
					to her, "all my sufferings, wounds <lb/>
					and bruises were for thee, to <lb/>
					save and redeem thy sinful soul." <lb/>
					This made a deep impression on her <lb/>
					mind, and she turned in earnest <lb/>
					prayer to the Lord, that he would <lb/>
					pardon her sins and transgressions <lb/>
					and renew a right spirit within <lb/>
					her, &amp; once when walking in a field <lb/>
					by herself, with tears and prayer <lb/>
					lifting up her hands to him, she <lb/>
					got an assurance that her guilt <lb/>
					should be done away, and that <lb/>
					he would prove her good Shepherd <lb/>
					<note type="catchword">who</note> <lb/>
				
			</p>
						<cb/>
			<p>
				
					who seeks that which was lost <lb/>
					with unwearied faithfulness. <lb/>
					This has followed <add place="above">her</add> all her life and  <lb/>
					often thro' grace been renewed. <lb/></p>
						<p>
					She now felt a desire to be closer <lb/>
					united with the Brns Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and  <lb/>
					to injoy the priviliges of the same. <lb/>
					Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760 she moved into the <lb/>
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House here in Fulnek, May 11. <lb/>
					1761 she was recd into the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb/>
					and May 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the following year <lb/>
					partook for the first time of <lb/>
					the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. She often spoke <lb/>
					with great pleasure, of the time <lb/>
					of her first com<del>m</del>ing, how happy <lb/>
					she was in communion with our <lb/>
					Saviour, and how comfortable the <lb/>
					S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> were together in the so called <lb/>
					spinning days, and how they delighted <lb/>
					midst great poverty in singing the <lb/>
					praises of the Lord. She was <lb/>
					soon impolyed in serving as an Over <lb/>

					seer with the Girls, and afterwards <lb/>
					with Sisters. In 1790 she was accepted  <lb/>
					atcoluth, and for 18 years she held <lb/>
					the Office of Houseservant, she  <lb/>
					showed much faithfulness in what <lb/>
					was committed to her, and looked <lb/>
					opon it as a favour, which <lb/>
					made her Office a pleasant duty. <lb/>
					<del>to her.</del> The last few years, she <lb/>
					was not able to do as formerly <lb/>
					but injoying the love of the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb/>
					they were willing to lend her a <lb/>
					helping hand whenever required, <lb/>
					particularly those S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in her room <lb/>
					showed her much love &amp; attention. <lb/>
					Tho' nothing very striking seemed to <lb/>
					distinguish her course, we are sure <lb/>
					that she lived in communion with <lb/>
					our Saviour, and with Childlike <lb/>
					confidence and humble faith looked <lb/>
					to him for help and support in <lb/>
					every time of need.  <lb/>

					Oct 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1810 she called to mind that <lb/>
					it was 50 years since she moved <lb/>
					into this house, she expressed <lb/>
					herself that she could not suffi- <lb/>
					ciently thank our Saviour, for all <lb/>
					his love and care, his longsuffering <lb/>
					and forbearance, and for all his  <lb/>
					mercy towards her, and looked back <lb/>
					with gratitude and amazement how <lb/>
					he had proved her true friends in <lb/>
					all her spiritual and temporal <lb/>
					concerns, that she had laked <lb/>
					nothing; and she renewed her  <lb/>
					convenant to cleave to him, to  <lb/>
					trust his Shepherd care, till <lb/>
					hope and faith shall cease, and <lb/>
					Love prevail alone. </p>
							<p>
					Hitherto she had injoyed an unin- <lb/>
					terrupted good stale of health, but <lb/>
					now she began to feel the infir- <lb/>
					mities of age, and for these last 3 <lb/>
					years, she was not able to attend

					the meetings as she used to do, <lb/>
					which was a great trial to her. </p>
						<p>
					She was however able to go about <lb/>
					in the house, tho' at last with <lb/>
					great difficulty, till the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb/>
					of this month, when she had to  <lb/>
					be confined to the sickroom, her <lb/>
					weakness increased rapidly; tho' <lb/>
					she did not think that her de- <lb/>
					parture was so near, she felt <lb/>
					resigned to our Saviours will, <lb/>
					saying: "My times are in his hands <lb/>
					"I can <del>say</del> do nothing but pray <lb/>
					"to him to receive me, a poor <lb/>
					"and worthless sinner, in mercy, <lb/>
					"and I am sure he will." - </p>
						<p>
					On the 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> she called to mind the <lb/>
					blessings she had often enjoyed on <lb/>
					that great memorial day, and  <lb/>
					particularly what she had felt the <lb/>
					first time, when she celebrated it <lb/>
					55 years ago, during the singing of <lb/>
					that verse: <lb/>

					<l>O Church, how many hast thou yet</l>
					<l>Who do not love the Saviour?</l>

					<l>O ye, who don't stand well with him,</l>
					<l>Do ye long for redemption?</l></lg>
				<lg type="verse">
					<l>Now, now, is for you the right time</l>

					<l>She spent the following days mostly</l>
					<l>in a slumber, and when she awoke</l>
					<l>between, <del>she</del> only complained on </l>
					<l>great weakness, she often folded</l>
					<l>her hands, as being ingaged in</l>
					<l>prayers, when the lipps no more</l>
					<l>could say; and on the 16<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> it </l>
