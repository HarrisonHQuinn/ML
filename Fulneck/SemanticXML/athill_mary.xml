					<p> Mary Athill died July / 46 <lb/> Born with twin S<hi rend="superscript"
							>r.</hi> Sarah in Antigua 18 <lb/> July 9 / 14. came to Brit<hi
							rend="superscript">n</hi> in 1821 first <lb/> to Edinbro&apos;, then to
						Fuln. Sch with elder <lb/> S<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> Esther; remained
						here till Oct<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> / 28, when <lb/> went first to
						London, where confirm<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> in <lb/> ch of Engl<hi
							rend="superscript">d</hi> in 1829 went back to Antigua <lb/> where
							rem<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> till / 36; after residence of <lb/> 5
						yrs in Lond came to live in S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> house <lb/> here
						in / 41. Admitted com<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> members <lb/> in summer /
						43.</p>
					<p> In the course of last year certain circum <lb/> stances occurred, which
						convinced our late <lb/> S<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>, in a painful
						manner, but most affec <lb/> tually of the emptiness &amp; deceitfulness of
						<lb/> this world; &amp; shewed her that, however se re <lb/> cluded mote
						from worldly vanity &amp; pleasure <lb/> our settlements may be, they are at
						the <lb/> same time screened from much evil, <lb/> &amp; unvisited by many
						&amp; placing <lb/> my bitter &amp; heart rending cares &amp; sor <lb/>
						rows; &amp; that true place &amp; lasting en <lb/> joyment are to be found
						only in the <lb/> ways of genuine piety; in a word, that <lb/>
						&quot;godliness with contentment&quot; is great <lb/> gain. The consequence
						was that, <lb/> after on returning, after an absence of <lb/> about 8 mo<hi
							rend="superscript">s.</hi> to our S<hi rend="superscript">rs&apos;
						</hi>house &amp; to the <lb/> church of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>.
						she evidently lived <lb/> in much more comfort than before, <lb/> set a
						higher value on her privileges, <lb/> temporal &amp; spiritual, seemed to
						enjoy <lb/> the means of grace, &amp; grew, we trust <lb/> in the inner way,
						in knowledge &amp; <lb/> in grace.</p>
					<p> Her health was always delicate, &amp; in <lb/> the course of last Winter,
						began to fail <lb/> more &amp; more, so that, in spring, fears began </p>

					<p> to be entertained of the result. In <lb/>
						<del>May</del> June last month she went to Burlington to try the <lb/>
						effect of the sea-air; but all was in vain, &amp; <lb/> she returned in abt.
						a fortnight <del>for</del>
						<lb/> weaker than when she left us. About a week After <lb/> her arrival
						here, however, she seemed to <lb/> rally very much so that we began to che
						<lb/> rish hopes of her eventual recovery; but she <lb/> soon sank again,
						&amp; very rapidly; &amp; a <lb/> physician being called in, at once de
						<lb/> clared that there was not a shadow of <lb/> hope. It fell to my lot to
						inform our <lb/> late sister of this, which I did in as gentle <lb/> a
						manner as I could devise. From the <lb/> commencement of her illness, she
						had <lb/> expressed a very great anxiety to recover; <lb/> &amp; tho&apos;
						she seemed aware how well <lb/> founded were the many hints were her <lb/>
						of the danger of her case, &amp; of the necessity <lb/> of preparing to meet
						her God, &amp; that she <lb/> certainly did not neglect the one thing <lb/>
						needful, yet she flattered herself with <lb/> hopes of recovery getting
						better &amp; clung to life, until <lb/> the interview I had with her above
						allu <lb/> ded to &amp; which took place in the evening <lb/> of 8<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi>, the day before her birthday. She <lb/>
						certainly seemed both alarmed &amp; distressed <lb/> when she at length
						learned there was no <lb/> hope; but she listened most eagerly, &amp; I
						<lb/> believe, with childlike faith, to my ear <lb/> nest adminitions, to
						turn to Jesus, the <lb/> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> from sin &amp;
						deathl &amp; also to the encou <lb/> ragements I endeavoured to give her, by
						<lb/> pourtraying in scripture-phrase, the <lb/> infinite compassion &amp;
						tender mercy <lb/> of that Sav<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi>, his readiness
						to pardon <lb/> &amp; receive every one that believeth. X <lb/> Before this
						period she had often been hard <lb/> X as well as to the fervent I offered
						up by her side </p>

					<p> praying very fervently in the night. ??? <lb/> for acceptance in the Beloved
						for pardon, <lb/> peace, santification &amp; redepemtion. <lb/> From the day
						just now mentioned, <lb/> July 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I found her,
						at each subse <lb/> quent visit, more &amp; more composed, <lb/> her light
						&amp; peace of mind continually <lb/> increasing; she was evidently
						delighted <lb/> to hear of Jesus, &amp; to listen to the prayers <lb/>
						offered up on her behalf &amp; was, no doubt, <lb/> very grateful to her
						choir-labourer &amp; <lb/> other friends for all spiritual advice &amp; en
						<lb/> couragement given her as well as for other proofs <lb/> of kindness
						&amp; various attentions. <lb/> I saw her last on Saturday 18<hi
							rend="superscript">th</hi> visit <lb/> about noon; she then told me,
						that she <lb/> felt quite happy &amp; had no fear of death <lb/> because she
						was persuaded that, tho&apos; she <lb/> knew herself to be a poor miserable
						<lb/> sinner, her Sav<hi rend="superscript">r.</hi> had pardoned her blotted
						<lb/> out all her sins, &amp; would receive her <lb/> in mercy to himself.
						In this peace <lb/> ful frame she continued until 5 <lb/> o&apos;clock on
						Sunday morning, when after <lb/> having suffered some violent convul <lb/>
						sions, she fell asleep in Jesus, aged <lb/> 32 years. </p>
					<p> Our last Sister&apos;s conduct was gene <lb/> rally speaking regular,
						strictly moral, <lb/> &amp; marked generally speaking, by <lb/> uprightness
						&amp; conscientiousness. <lb/> Yet we will not deny that there were <lb/>
						not many decided manifestations in <lb/> her character, of spiritual life,
						until <lb/> her last illness. the good Providence <lb/> of God led her last
						year thro&apos; heavy trials, which <lb/> ever bless for her instruction in
						<lb/> righteousness, &amp; prepared her we believe, </p>

					<p> for those life-giving operations of His <lb/> spirit, which finally issued
						contract <lb/>
						<del>&amp; believe</del> in <del>her</del> full salvation, &amp; in her
						<lb/> being needs meet for the inheritance <lb/> of the saints in light. May
						the <lb/> Lord be the consolation &amp; support of <lb/> her surviving twin
						sister &amp; give her <lb/> both her &amp; all our young members <lb/> yea
						of all us grace. to give diligence <lb/> to make our calling &amp; election
						sure, <lb/> &amp; to work while it is called to day <lb/> seeing the night
						cometh, in which no <lb/> man can work. </p>
