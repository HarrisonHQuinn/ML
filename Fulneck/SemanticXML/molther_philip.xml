						<roleName type="honorific">Our Saviour</roleName> pursued me also here by

						<lb/> I hastened to my room <name type="emotion">trembling, and <lb/>

					<p> at <placeName>Jena</placeName>, on which occasion I prayed to <persName type="deity"

						<lb/> readiness to receive the poorest and most <lb/> miserable sinners

					<p> that moment believingly to Him, in a manner <lb/> as I had never been able to do, and I
						<lb/> felt that sin had been <del>laimed</del> maimed <lb/> and lost its
						force. Declining the propo- <lb/> sal of my Father, to return home and <lb/>
						to accept of a living, he withdrew his <lb/> asistance, which on the one
						hand obliged <lb/> me to find my support by teaching frensh <lb/> but set me
						on the other hand at liberty <lb/> from accepting my father&apos;s proposal
						con <lb/> trary to the dictates of my heart. <persName>Christian <lb/>

						<lb/> under the care of <persName>John Nitchman</persName>, to <lb/>
						<placeName>Jena</placeName>, I had the pleasure <name occupation="teacher"
							>to be his teacher <lb/> in music and the frensh language</name>. About
						easter the same year the late ordinar <lb/> travelling through
							<persName>Jena</persName>, he had an enteview <lb/> with all those who
						were employed to teach <lb/> his son, and asked every one, after he had
						<lb/> first spoke with each of us separately: <lb/>Wether we were willing to
						devote ourselves <note type="catchword">to</note>

					<cb/>
					<p> to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> and the

						<add place="above">were</add>desirous to be prepared for serving our
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>
						<lb/> Every one said yes. But the question being <lb/> put to me, I
						answered: &quot;I am convinced <lb/> that I ought to devote myself to our <lb/>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, and to be converted to him
						with <lb/> my whole heart, for not doing it will <lb/> render me an
						unfortunate man. But to <lb/> be devoted to the
							<orgName>Congregation</orgName> I do not <lb/> understand.&quot; He
						replied: &quot;It is very well, <lb/> this matter is only for such as

						son&quot;. In <date when-iso="1737-06">June of the same year</date> our <lb/>
						<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> was pleased to convince me, in
						<lb/> a most striking manner of my call <lb/> of to the brethren&apos;s
						church, which time I <lb/> never shall forget. Till now I thought <lb/> as

					<p> see or attend to our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>&apos;s views with me.
						<lb/> Previous to my going to <roleName>doctor</roleName>
						<persName>Hamburgers</persName>
						<lb/> lectures upon natural philosophy, I <lb/> meditated about myself and
						prayed to <lb/> our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>, who was
						pleased to speak <lb/> to my heart and to lead me into a serious <lb/>
						consideration concerning my past and <lb/> future course. The following
						questions <lb/> were brought home to my heart: &quot;What will <lb/> become
						of you at last and in what manner <lb/> will your studies terminate? You
						can&apos;t stay <lb/> always at the university. If you become <lb/> a <name
							occupation="minister">minister</name> in your native country what <lb/>
						benefit will it be of to you on others; <lb/> for if you go without being
						sent by me, you <lb/> will be an unprofitable servant, and it <lb/> may
						terminate with you as with other awa- <lb/> kened students who did not
						prosper.&quot; It <lb/> you will save your soul take refuge to <lb/> the
							<orgName>brethrens congregation</orgName>&quot; &amp;c. These and <note
							type="catchword">other</note>
					</p>
					<cb/>
					<p> others considerations came with such clearness <lb/> into my heart as if our <roleName
							type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> was pre- <lb/> sent and speaking to
						me, and I was en- <lb/> abled to acquiesce and say amen to all, <lb/> with
						my whole heart. Now I knew <lb/> what I was about, heard and saw every <lb/>
						thing in another light, and my eye being <lb/> single the whole body was
						light, so that <lb/> I could not help wondering at the change <lb/> wrought
						in me. I moved with the consent <lb/> of <persName>John Nitchman</persName>
						in the <date when-iso="1737-07">month of July</date>
						<lb/> into the <add place="above">house</add> of of the young count, and
							<del>which</del> was <lb/> exceedingly happy in the company of the <lb/>
						brethren. <persName>John Nitchman</persName> was beloved <lb/> and respected
						as a father among us, and <lb/> cared for the good of our souls with <lb/>
						much love and faithfulness. Our main <lb/> view was to become like little
						children, and <lb/> such a spirit of love and zeal prevailed <lb/> among us,
						that we sat many a night <note type="catchword">till</note>

					<p> till one a clock together, speaking of the <lb/> state of our souls and singing praises to
						<lb/> him, who had chosen us from before the <lb/> foundation of the world,
						and called us <lb/> from among the confusion of the learned <lb/> world to
						his people, and to whom we <lb/> now wished to devote ourselves, with heart-
						<lb/> felt joy as living sacrifices. In the <date when-iso="1733">year <lb/>
							1733</date> we went with the <persName ana="John Nitchma">young
							count</persName> to <placeName>Berlin</placeName>
						<lb/> where his father resided, having about 70 pil <lb/> grims with him.
						This was a blessed time <lb/> for me. The singing of the
							<orgName>brethren</orgName> and <lb/>
						<orgName>Sisters</orgName> and the discourses of the late ordinary <lb/>
						were attended with unction and the demons- <lb/> tration of the spirit of
							<persName type="deity">God</persName>. <date when-iso="1733-2-08">Feb<hi

								>22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi></date>
						<lb/> I was admitted to the <name event="communion">Lord&apos;s

					<p>Tho our lord had givin given me striking <lb/> proofs of his Grace, I was yet
						subject <lb/> to many changes. This true foundation <note type="catchword"
							>was</note>
					</p>
					<cb/>
					<p> was laid in my heart, and I was delivered <lb/> from sin. But being ignorant of the previ-
						<lb/> ledges our <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>&apos;s
						patients are intitled <lb/> to, I perplexed myself often at feeling <lb/> my
						innate depravity and did not know <lb/> how to look upon it. But now it
						pleased <lb/> the friend of my soul to remove this by gran- <lb/> ting me
						the favor to cast a believing look <lb/> upon Him as my all sufficient
							<roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName>; for <lb/> being at the
						comn Liturgy in deep and grate- <lb/> ful meditation concerning the great
						favor I <lb/> had enjoyed in eating and drinking the flesh <lb/> and blood
						of the son of man sacramentally, <lb/> and sighing to him, to make me quite
						happy; <lb/> he appeared in<add place="above">such</add> a most striking
						manner <lb/> to my heart as my bleeding and suffering <lb/>
						<roleName type="honorific">Redeemer</roleName>, that I melted into tears
						like <lb/> wax before the fire. From that time I <lb/> proceeded from grace

					<p> love had captivated my heart became <lb/> daily more confident, and my <del>gracious</del>
						<lb/> call<add place="above">of Grace</add> to belong to the congn more
						impor- <lb/> tant and precious. Having stayed 5 months <lb/> at
							<placeName>Berlin</placeName> we returned to <placeName>Jena</placeName>
						where the <lb/> testimony of <persName type="deity">Jesu&apos;s</persName>
						Blood approved itself <lb/> as the power of <persName type="deity"
							>God</persName> to salvation upon many <lb/> students and others. In the
						year <date when-iso="1739">1739</date> we <lb/> were called to
							<placeName>Wetteravia</placeName>, which proved a <lb/> means to bring
						me to the <orgName>Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi></orgName> at Marien-
						<lb/> born. <date when-iso="1739-06-01">July the 1<hi rend="superscript"

								rend="superscript">t</hi> Thomas</placeName> in the
							<placeName>Westindies</placeName>. As soon <lb/> as he had saluted me he
						said: &quot;My brother <lb/> I have spoken to our <roleName type="honorific"
							>Saviour</roleName> concerning <lb/> you, whilst I was at sea. He has
						ordered <lb/> me to mention to you in his name, that <lb/> you are to go to
							<placeName>Pensylvania</placeName> to preach <lb/> the gospel in the
						whole country.&quot; I replied: <lb/> "Here I am may he do with me what is
