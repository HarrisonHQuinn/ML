					The single S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Rachel Bradley who hap- <lb />
					pily departed this life Aug. 30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1809. <lb />
					has left the following short account: <lb />
					I was born in Goweer in the parish <lb />
					of Huddersfield Oct 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1742. Shortly <lb />
					before I was born, my Mother began <lb />
					to attend the meetings of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>; <lb />
					and as soon as she possibly could <lb />
					she took me to the meetings too, the <lb />
					first time I remember having any serious <lb />
					thoughts concerning our Saviour was <lb />
					in my 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year, when B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hauptman <lb />
					was Keeping as a Childrens meeting: <lb />
					He spoke so movingly about the suf <lb />
					ferings &amp; death of our Saviour that it <lb />
					made a deep impression on my mind. <lb />
					It being Good friday, he told us that <lb />
					this was the day when the Lord died <lb />
					to redeem us out of the hand of the <lb />
					destroyer, telling us to pray to our Sa- <lb />
					viour to make us good &amp; happy Chil- <lb />
					dren, and give us a Heart to love him. <lb />
					I <del>prayed if</del> thought, so I will, &amp; prayed <lb />
					fervently, so that I felt him very near

					to my heart. Going to Bed at night I <lb />
					thought I saw our Saviour, he showed <lb />
					me his hands &amp; his feet, and I felt <lb />
					such a love to him, that I beg&apos;d <lb />
					of him to take me to himself. <lb />
					In my 8<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year my Parents being in <lb />
					very low circumstances, my Oncle and <lb />
					Aunt payed us a visit, and offered <lb />
					to take one of us Children to their <lb />
					house, my Aunt fixed her choice on <lb />
					me, to my great grief, because she <lb />
					had no liking for the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. As <lb />
					my Parents insisted upon me going <lb />
					I went out of obedience, but spent <lb />
					2 very unhappy years. My B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Richard <lb />
					coming from Fulnek about that time <lb />
					gave me an oppertunity to aquaint <lb />
					him with the uneasiness of my mind, <lb />
					I told him that I should never go <lb />
					to Heaven if I remained here. He <lb />
					asked me where I should wish to <lb />
					be? I answered any where among the <lb />
					B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. My inclination was to live <lb />
					with the S. S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, but could not see
			</p>
					<cb/>
			<p>
				
					how it was possible to be brought about. <lb />
					Being one Night very uneasy, I kneel- <lb />
					ed down by my bed, and prayed <lb />
					to our Saviour with many tears, that <lb />
					if is was his mind for me to live <lb />
					with the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> he would make it <lb />
					known to me, by putting it into <lb />
					my Mothers heart, to come and see <lb />
					me, that I might tell her all <lb />
					the trouble of my mind; to my <lb />
					great surprise she came next mor- <lb />
					ning, I was struk, and thanked <add place="above">to</add> the <lb />
					Lord, because I knew it was his doing. <lb />
					When she asked me how I did <lb />
					I answered; very well! she said she <lb />
					was glad to hear it, for she suffered <lb />
					much on my account the last night <lb />
					&amp; could have no ease of mind till <lb />
					she knew what was the matter <lb />
					with me. I inquired about her re- <lb />
					turn, she told me in the afternoon, <lb />
					I took no farther notice, but dressed <lb />
					myself to go with her, on seing what <lb />
					I was about she wished me not to

					do it, saying my Father would be much <lb />
					displeased, not withstanding I set <lb />
					out, but my Mother using all manners <lb />
					of persuasion for me to remain where <lb />
					I was, I told her that I could not <lb />
					return, unless she spoke with B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					Pyrlaus concerning me, which she faith <lb />
					fully promised to do, &amp; I returned to my <lb />
					Oncle &amp; Aunt who rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> me gladly, telling <lb />
					me that I was beloved by them as <lb />
					their own Child. I thanked them for <lb />
					their Kindness towards me, but aquaint- <lb />
					ed them with nothing farther. My <lb />
					Mother fulfilled her promise, spoke <lb />
					to the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; they soon found a place <lb />
					for me, my S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> came to fetch me <lb />
					&amp; I felt very thankful to the Lord <lb />
					for what he had done for me. <lb />
					The next day we came to Little town <lb />
					where I remained for a short time, <lb />
					from thence I obtained leave to live <lb />
					in Gummersal S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> House, and after <lb />
					living 2 years there, I removed to  <lb />
					Fulnek. Now indeed my heart was <lb />
					melted before our Saviour, seing with <lb />

					what unwearied Kindness &amp; patience <del>our <lb />
					Saviour</del> he has followed me, I shed <lb />
					sinner tears before him, and intreated <lb />
					him fervently to keep &amp; protect me <lb />
					during my pilgrimage here below; <lb />
					&amp; I must own to his praise that he has <lb />
					never left nor forsaken me, I feel my <lb />
					self a very great sinner, but hope thro&apos; <lb />
					his enabling grace I shall give joy to <lb />
					our Saviour &amp; his Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. I my 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
					year I had the favour to be rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> <lb />
					into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> which proved a great <lb />
					blessing to my heart. But now the <lb />
					depravity of human nature began to <lb />
					show itself more &amp; more. I felt a great <lb />
					inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this <lb />
					world &amp; often thought of going back &amp; <lb />
					leave the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>; I grew also very re- <lb />
					served, so that I could not open <lb />
					my heart to any one. But my ever <lb />
					faithful Saviour <add place="above">followed</add> me his poor Child <lb />
					with unwearied Kindness &amp; made it <lb />
					clear to me that it was his will that <lb />

					nation not to return till our Saviour <lb />
					had manifested himself to me in his <lb />
					bleeding &amp; dying form, he as the best <lb />
					friend of sinners granted my request, <lb />
					asuring me at the same time of the <lb />
					forgiveness of all my sins. I now <lb />
					returned home happy and comfort- <lb />
					able, in the nearness of my mercyful <lb />
					Saviour, he also gave me grace that <lb />
					without reserve I could open my <lb />
					mind to my Choir. Labores. wishing <lb />
					to keep noting hid which might hin- <lb />

					a great desire to enjoy the Holy <lb />
					Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> and this great favour was gran <lb />
					to me in my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year. And now <lb />
					I wish for nothing else, but to re- <lb />
					main sitting at his thro&apos; piersed feet <lb />
					&amp; greeting them for my election of grace. <lb />
					I own and feel myself as the poorest <lb />
					of sinners, and have nothing to plead <lb />
					but his mercy. With patience immense <lb />
					With love most intense - Hath he led <lb />
					me on, - I&apos;m lost in amezement  <lb />

					Thus far her own Account, which she dictated <lb />
					to a friend in the year 1805. and added <lb />
					at the same time, that this short acc<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> <lb />
					given of her early life had been the <lb />
					most remarkable to her, and the period <lb />
					in which she sought &amp; found real <lb />
					happiness, &amp; tho&apos; more then 40 years <lb />
					had elaps&apos;d since, during which time <lb />
					<hi rend="underline">much</hi> had occurred yet she could say <lb />
					nothing more, but thank and praise our <lb />
					our Saviour for all his love &amp; care. &amp; <lb />

					shortfallings. We can add to this, <lb />
					that she was devoted with soul &amp; body <lb />
					to the Lord, his suffering beauty had cap- <lb />
					tivated her heart, to read &amp; speak about that <lb />
					subject was her greatest dilight, she was also <lb />
					useful in several ways, &amp; served with a willing <lb />
					&amp; chearful heart. Tho&apos; she had a very sickly <lb />
					tabernacle, and was several times so ill that <lb />
					no hopes was left for her recovery, yet she <lb />
					was resigned to our Saviours will, and could  <lb />
					never express her graditute sufficenly for his <lb />
					help &amp; support both internal &amp; external. <lb />

					asmatick complaint, but she bore it with <lb />
					great patience, &amp; sought comfort with him <lb />
					who has been her refuce in all trouble. <lb />
					As she loved &amp; was beloved it was a pleasure <lb />
					to her to be in her room with the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> as <lb />
					long as she was able to go down, but about <lb />
					3 weeks before her departure she was obliged to <lb />
					confine herself to the sickroom. She expressed <lb />
					herself on that occation, to the following effect: <lb />
					&quot;I have now done with all things in this world <lb />
					and am waiting for our Saviour to take me <lb />
					to my eternal home, I am lost in wonder when <lb />
					I think on his love &amp; faithfulness, to me the <lb />
					poorest among the needy, O what a blessed thing <add place="above">it is,</add> <lb />
					that he has given me that asurence | tho I deserv&apos;d <lb />

					sinner tears &amp; say to him; This Lord Jesus is <lb />
					my only plea, Here is a sinner who would <lb />
					fain - Thro the Lambs ransom entrance gain. <lb />
					With these happy meditations she spent her time, <lb />
					| tho&apos; she suffered much of shortness of breath | till <lb />
