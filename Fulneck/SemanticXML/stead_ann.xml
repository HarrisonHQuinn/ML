					The Life of the mar<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>. Sr Ann stead who departed <lb/>
					to her Redeemer June 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1772
				</p>
			<p>
					She herself dictated the following to her Husband.
				</p>
			<p>
				I was born at Bradford March 28<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1730 &amp; educated in the <lb/>
				Church of England. I grew up in a very careless manner <lb/>
				having no particular thoughts or Concern about my Salva- <lb/>
				tion. In the Year 1750 I was married to my present <lb/>
				Husband who belonged to the Brethren's Society, but being <lb/>
					gay &amp; liking the world &amp; the ways thereof, I was much
					against his going to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Meetings, which occasioned <lb/>
				him to speak very seriously <add place="above">tho tenderly</add> with me when he told me <lb/>
				his Reasons for going among the Brethren, &amp; that he for him, <lb/>
				self was determined to continue his Connexion with them <lb/>
				&amp; adhere to the Doctrine he had heard of them, but would <lb/>
				give me full liberty to go to divine Service <lb/>
				whenever I chose. I was not satisfied long to go a dif- <lb/>
				ferent way to my husband, &amp; moreover seeing something <lb/>
				more in him than I saw in myself &amp; many others I was <lb/>
				drawn to go with him. In 1751 we moved to Pudsey where <lb/>
				I not only attended the Meetings of the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> but also got <lb/>
				requainted with them to the blessing of my Heart, &amp; soon <lb/>
				after was received into the Society. About this Time <lb/>
				our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> began to labour powerfully on my Heart, &amp; <lb/>
				particularly did He make it clear to me what a wretched <lb/>
				miserable Sinner I was, &amp; I continued for some Time in <lb/>
				great distress of Soul, not knowing what to do or how <lb/>
				I should be helped. In this Condition I once went in great <lb/>
				Heaviness to a Meeting which B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Parminter held, during <lb/>
				which the Lord manifested Himself to my Heart in his <lb/>
				bloody Form just so as He expired on the Cross, and He  <lb/>
				asured me that He had blotted out all my Sins &amp; received <lb/>
				me as by Child. This was an Hour of grace that has never

				since been erased out of my Mind. Now I was full of joy <lb/>
				&amp; Thankfulnes for the mercy He had shown to my Soul. &amp; <lb/>
				ever since He has given me that grace that all Times <lb/>
				&amp; amidst the farther knowlege I had of my own Depravity <lb/>
				I could always go confidently to Him with all my Concerns <lb/>
				&amp; cast myself with them upon his merciful Heart &amp; He <lb/>
				has approved Himself gracious &amp; faithful to me. Jan: 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb/>
				1757 I was rec<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> during an overpowering <lb/>
				feeling of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Love which melted my Heart in such <lb/>
				a Manner as I am not able to express. apr. 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1761 I was <lb/>
				admitted to the holy Communion, which grace made me <lb/>
				deeply ashamed, feeling my great unworthiness. This <lb/>
				caused me to examine more strictly into <lb/>
				my own Heart, &amp; which also proved the Occasion of my <lb/>
				diving still deeper into for Heart of Love &amp; experiencing <lb/>
				more of the grace which He had in Store for me. <lb/>
				</p>
			<p>
					So far her own Account.
				</p>
			<p>
				She had a tender Heart to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; spent her <lb/>
				Time in Communion with Him. Her marriage was <lb/>
				blest with 10 Children 5 of whom went Home before <lb/>
				her. She was in a poor state of Health before the <lb/>
				Birth of her last child in January &amp; has never been <lb/>
				well since then. In her Sickness her Children lay, <lb/>
				upon her Mind with much Concern, &amp; she was <add place="above">exceedingly</add> <lb/>
				pained at thinking how it might go with them, but <lb/>
				was obliged to commit them to the Mercy of God <lb/>
					She was tenderly occupied with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>
				<add place="above">and what He had done for her</add> &amp; had no Incli-  <lb/>
				nation for Conversation about any other Subject, but <lb/>
				was all alive whenever He was spoken or sung of. The <lb/>
					time of her Sickness was a Season of real grace &amp; Blessing

				to her Heart, &amp; on extraordinary presence of our <lb/>
				Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> was perceived by all the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> whenever <lb/>
				they visited her, which made it a comfort &amp; Blessing to <lb/>
				them. Her whole Mind was bent upon going Home, <lb/>
				Being asked if she should not like to recover again <lb/>
				she replied: "O no! I would mend again for a 1000 worlds." <lb/>
				Being asked by some of her Neighbours, if she was not <lb/>
				afraid to die, &amp; whether she had no dark apprehen-  <lb/>
				sion at the Thoughts of being soon in Eternity? <lb/>
				She answered: "no, I have neither Fear nor dark <lb/>
				apprehensions, but can resign my Soul to my <lb/>
				Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> with joy &amp; with the same <add place="above">composure</add> &amp; serenity as when <lb/>
				I go to sleep at Nights because He has granted me <lb/>
					the Happiness to know Him as my Friend &amp; Redeemer."
				</p>
			<p>
				She had the holy Communion administred to her <lb/>
				twice in her House, attended with an extraordinary <lb/>
				Feeling of grace. Thus she remained, an Edifica: <lb/>
				to those who saw &amp; spoke with her, till it pleased <lb/>
					our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to fetch her Soul to Himself in her 43<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Year.
