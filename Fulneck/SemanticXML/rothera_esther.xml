					<placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName>.
				</p>
			<p>
				Our happily deceased <roleName type="honorific">Sister</roleName>, was <name relation="child">Daughter</name> to <persName cert="high" type="real">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
<lb/>
Farrer</persName> in <placeName cert="high">Soyland</placeName>, in the Parish of <placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName> where she <lb/>
				was born <date calendar="Julian" when="1760-02-02" cert="high">Febr 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1706 O.S</date>. and brought up in the <lb/>
				principles of the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> in a carefull and <lb/>
					religious manner.
				</p>
			<p>
				The following <add place="above">is her own</add> account (of her was noted down by her <lb/>
					<persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> Joshua Metcalf</persName> from her own mouth:)
				</p>
			<p>
				"When I was <date cert="medium" when="1714">8 Years old</date>, I can remember, that I was <lb/>
				weary about the Salvation of my Soul. I felt the <lb/>
				drawings of my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> in my heart (and thought <lb/>
				the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> meant to shew me something more than <lb/>
				the rest of my <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> </orgName> or even any of my kindred). <lb/>
				<date cert="medium" when="1719">About the Age of 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> </date> I was made more sensible of <lb/>
				the Corruption of my nature and convinced that I <lb/>
				was not right, but how to find Rest for my heart <lb/>
				I knew not. My guilty conscience made me evry <lb/>
				where afraid. I often thought the grand Enemy of <lb/>
				Souls was in the room with me, and was so frighted <lb/>
				that I would not sleep alone in a room so that <lb/>
				they were obliged to take me into that of my Father <lb/>
				and Mother. My Father departed this LIfe soon <lb/>
				after, and When <date cert="medium" when="1721">I was 15 Years old</date> I was turnd <lb/>
				into the World to earn my own Bread. My Mo- <lb/>
				ther would not let me live in a publik Town, <lb/>
				she had a concern for my Soul, and thought it <lb/>
				was too dangerous for young people. I went <lb/>
				therefore to live with a Widow Woman in the Country <lb/>
				and stayd with her near 2 Years. One of my <lb/>
				Sisters sent afterwards for me and desired me <lb/>
				to come and live with her, which I did. Ha- <lb/>

				Having been with her some Years I returned and soon <lb/>
					after went to live at <placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName>. <del>Being now</del>
				<add place="above">When I was</add> <date cert="medium" when="1731">25 <lb/>
				Years</date> old I got a fresh Call from my dear <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, I <lb/>
				saw my sad wretched and dismal State, which I <lb/>
				was in by nature, with more conviction and distress. <lb/>
				I had no rest in my Soul by reason of my Sins. They <lb/>
				increased and the depravity of nature grew <lb/>
				stronger &amp; stronger. I made one promise after the <lb/>
				other, took one resolution after the other to leave off doing <lb/>
				Evil and to mend my manner of Life, but all to no <lb/>
				purpose. My good will came to nought. Alas! I had no <lb/>
				power in myself, Nature ruled, Sin was my Master, <lb/>
					and I was a perfect Slave.
				</p>
			<p>
				In my <date cert="medium" when="1733">27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year</date> I changed my condition &amp; was <name event="marriage" when-iso="1733">married</name> <lb/>
				to my husband <persName cert="high" type="real">Crispin Rothera</persName>. I hoped thereby to be <lb/>
				delivered out of dangers, and <del>that</del> to become more religious <lb/>
				But this availed nothing neither, I was conscious that I <lb/>
				was not in a State of heart that could please <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>. My <lb/>
				poor Soul had no rest. I often knew not what to do for <lb/>
				trouble of mind and Anxiety of heart. Certainly, thought <lb/>
				I, there is no rest and Comfort to be found in any state <lb/>
				whatsoever, that I can see into, as yet. O thought I, <lb/>
				what a dismal condemned Situation am I in, having <lb/>
				no rest in my heart by day <del>n</del>or night. I went con- <lb/>
				stantly to Church, and Prayers, read religious books &amp; <lb/>
					did all I could, but remained the same, as I was.
					At Length I got to hear, that a new Preacher, One</p>
			<p>					<persName ref="#mlper000536" cert="high" type="real">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persName>, was to come to <placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName> &amp; <del>to</del> preach in <lb/>
				the Church. Him I went to hear, his preaching confir- <lb/>
				med me in my thoughts, that I was in a lost and un- <lb/>
				done Condition, which he set forth as I found it in <lb/>
				my own heart. I went home full of uneasiness of mind, <lb/>
				and condemned in heart, retired into a place by myself  <lb/>
				<note type="catchword">fell</note>
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_45_RotheraEsther-03.jpg" n="3"/>
			<p>
				
				fell down upon my knees in order to pray, but <lb/>
				could do nothing but Sigh. My heart was quite broken, <lb/>
				and I wept abundance of tears. How I felt then I <lb/>
				cannot express in Words. I got some comfort and <lb/>
				hoped it would go better. But I found however no <lb/>
					abiding rest and Satisfaction for my heart.</p>
			<p>					A little time after I got to hear that some Germans or as <lb/>
				others called them <orgName religion="Moravian Church">Moravian Brethren</orgName> came to preach in <lb/>
				<placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName>. They brought us the sweet &amp; comfortable Tidings <lb/>
				of the Salvation of Sinners thro' the Sufferings &amp; Death <lb/>
				of <persName type="real" cert="high">Jesus</persName>, inviting the poor and miserable to come just <lb/>
				as they were to their wounded <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> and seek for <lb/>
				Grace at his feet, <add place="above">declaring that</add> he had redeemed us and would freely <lb/>
					save us from Sin, &amp; give rest to our Souls.</p>
			<p>					Their Words came with power to my heart, I rejoiced <lb/>
				at this good News, and got hopes that he would have <lb/>
				Mercy on me poor miserable Sinner. I frequented <lb/>
				their <name event="religious">Meetings</name> as often as my poor State of health <lb/>
				would permit. When I went the very first time <lb/>
				to <placeName ref="#mlpla000065" cert="high">Smithhouse</placeName> to a <name event="religious">Meeting</name> there (and came on the <lb/>
					Bank Top,) I was thrown <add place="above">from</add>
				<del>by</del> the horse. I thought <lb/>
				within myself, this is the Enemys Doing, to keep me <lb/>
				back and to hinder me from going. I went however <lb/>
				forward, (and desired those that were with me, not <lb/>
				to tell my husband or others of it, lest he should <lb/>
				hinder me to go again.) I was a quarter of a Year <lb/>
				sick afterwards. The more I heard the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> the more <lb/>
				I saw the deep Corruption of my heart, being of a <lb/>
				proud, passionate temper, and inclined to be selfrightious. I resolved to be our Saviours with Soul &amp; <lb/>
				body, and parted with whatsoever I thought would <lb/>
				prove a hindrance to my happiness, and step in <lb/>
				betwixt me and our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. I used to spin worsted <lb/>
				and had saved the bits of Ends now &amp; then to <lb/>
					make in time a pair of Stockings out of them
				
			</p>
			<pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MAF/Ful_3_45_RotheraEsther-04.jpg" n="4"/>
			<p>
				
				This I looked upon as an Injustice by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I had wronged <lb/>
				the Master. It caused me much Uneasiness. I could not <lb/>
				be satisfied, till I had confessed it to the Owner and made <lb/>
				Satisfaction. He looked upon it as an instance of great <lb/>
					honesty and had ever after a great respect for me.</p>
			<p>					I thought, whosoever will be reconciled unto God, must also re-  <lb/>
					ctify all unjust things between Man &amp; Man.
				</p>
			<p>
				B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ockerhousen came afterwards to keep Meetings at <lb/>
				Hallifax, which I attended with blessing for my heart, beg <lb/>
				ged to be under the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> Care and in their Society, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> <lb/>
				also was granted to my great Joy and was thankfull for it. <lb/>
				I continued also to go to Church but seldom heard what my <lb/>
				Soul longed for; and often sighed: <hi rend="underline">Thou o dear Jesu! Shalt be <lb/>
					my all, my Sacrifice and Priest. Thou art too strong for all <lb/>
					my bitterest Foes. None can thy Blood successfully oppose."</hi>
				</p>
			<p>
				Upon her earnest request she was received into the Congregation <lb/>
				and got her right and Title amidst the Flock &amp; house of God  <lb/>
				and she <lb/>
					was admitted to the holy Sacrament
				</p>
			<p>
				her Spirit was lively, but her tabernacle subject to many In- <lb/>
				firmities. An Asthmatic disorder hindered her these many <lb/>
				Years from going much abroad. But as long as she could <lb/>
				creep, she seldom missed any Meetings. To read the holy <lb/>
				Scripture was her private comfort, and she had got very <lb/>
				much aquainted with it, and thought much abt under- <lb/>
				standing the same and feeling in her own heart what <lb/>
				she read. These latter 12 months past her Infirmity grew <lb/>
				stronger and her short breath <del>has</del> prevented her from go- <lb/>
				ing as far even as to the Stanary. But during the Meeting <lb/>
				she usually had her private Devotion to the head so <lb/>
				full of bruises (and was very glad when any of her friends <lb/>
				would tell her the Subject of hte Discourse.) She loved <lb/>
					the Congr<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> with all her heart, (All the scandalous reports
				
			</p>

			<p>
				
				defamatory Libels or reasoning ag<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> did not shake <lb/>
				her. She believed solidly the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> Church to be our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> <lb/>
				peculiar people and rejoiced that she had the Grace <lb/>
				to be a member of the same. She often said to those <lb/>
				that reasoned ag<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> them or bro<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> all sorts of Tales to her: <lb/>
				"The B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> will stand and all those that are against them will <lb/>
				be confounded and found Lyars, for the Lord is with them <lb/>
				She and her husband had some years ago got Leave to <lb/>
				come and live among the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> at Lambshill, But her <lb/>
				husband from a Scrupulosity ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> his coming thro &amp; <lb/>
				getting his Livelyhood, declined it. She was often <lb/>
				grieved abt it and said: "Tho she loved her husband very <lb/>
				much, yet that thing she could hardly forgive him.) <lb/>
				Their house was open for the Brn at all times, and she <lb/>
				<del>their</del> thought it a great Blessing if they would put <lb/>
				up with the Entertainment and reception she could <lb/>
				give them. She was these many months in great <lb/>
				pain all over, but could forget it easily when she <lb/>
				had an opporutnity of conversing with any one abt  <lb/>
				our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and his Wounds. Many of her Neighbours <lb/>
				and acquaintances came sometimes to talk with her. <lb/>
				They had a peculiar confidence to her and told her <lb/>
				freely their troubles (whether outward or inward) She <lb/>
				used to comfort them with the meritorious troubles <lb/>
				and Sufferings of our blessed Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> for us (When <lb/>
				she met with any that had fallen out, or had an <lb/>
					Enmity ag<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> each other, She would tell <del>every</del>
				<add place="above">each</add> one <lb/>
				that it came from their bad heart, which <del>they</del> <lb/>
				at such opportunites shewd itself, that they might <lb/>
				know it, and seek to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> to be cured) She was <lb/>
				one of them that endeavoured to make Peace between <lb/>
				persons and her Counsel was often blessed &amp; <lb/>
				successful. (A few days before her Dissolution she <lb/>
				desired that some persons might be called to her, be- <lb/>
					cause she knnew that they thro Reasoning had

				brought themselves into Darkness and were suffering harm, <lb/>
				Those abt her said: It would be of no Effect, she would do no <lb/>
				good to them, she should let it alone, because she was so weak <lb/>
				and would only make herself uneasy, She answ: Pray, <lb/>
				let me do it, one does not know, what the last words of a dying <lb/>
				person may effect upon them. Her S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Alice Metcalf was <lb/>
				these several months mostly ab<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> her in the day time, and can <lb/>
				not express, what a Blessing she has been to her in the troubles <lb/>
					of mind in which She was of late.
				</p>
			<p>
				One has those many years expected that she would not hold <lb/>
				long, but her peculiar Chearfullness, patience &amp; Sinnerlikeness <lb/>
				made them all think, that our Savr would take her home <lb/>
				unto himself, and that she would not recover this time) <lb/>
				Last good fryday after the publick Meeting, she <lb/>
				had her Share in the holy Sacramt brought unto her by B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb/>
				Pyrlaus; she received it with great Bowedness &amp; Eagerness &amp; <lb/>
				the Transaction was attended with an awfull and sensible <lb/>
				feeling of the nearness of our tormented husband. And  <lb/>
				this proved to be the last time. (When B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Pyrlaus was <lb/>
				to visit her June 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> and spoke the Communicants, the latter <lb/>
				spoke also with our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>: &amp; asked her, whether she thought <lb/>
				she would continue<del>d</del> till she had got the Corpse &amp; blood of her <lb/>
				d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Spouse in the Sacram<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> She answ<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> no, I shall no more be <lb/>

				Some months ago, when she thought that this her present Illness <lb/>

				I relfect upon my husband I am anxious. I know him <lb/>
				best, I am in pain for him. She often with Tears begd <lb/>

				our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> hands &amp; the faithfull Care of ye B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi>. He <lb/>
				told us, that the close Connexion she had with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb/>
				in the day time, continued also in the night, he often <lb/>
				was waked by hearing her sing in Sleep, she sometimes <lb/>
				<del>would</del> spoke tenderly with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> and often had re- <lb/>
				freshing Dreams of him. (Four days before her dissolut <lb/>
				ion she dreamed: That a man came to her Bedside <lb/>
				and took her Drinking Pot, drunk all up, that <del>she</del> <lb/>
				<del>had</del> was put there for her refreshment. She thinking it  <lb/>
				was her husband, reasoned within herself &amp; thought It is <lb/>
					however quite wrong in him, to <add place="above">sip of</add>
				<del>take</del> my Drink, all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> <lb/>
				little refreshm<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I can take, <del>and to</del> But at Looking at  <lb/>
				him It struck into her mind That it was the Saviour. O <lb/>
				thought she: It is my dearest Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> he is wellcome to it, <lb/>
				he shall have me and all what I have. She catchd hold <lb/>
				of him at the same time &amp; cried: Dont leave, dont <lb/>
				Leave me, take me with Thee. He thereupon took her by <lb/>
				one arm, threw her over his Shoulders. She clasp her <lb/>
				arm round his neck &amp; Thought Well! new he has me <lb/>
				I will hold him fast. And while he carried her away, <lb/>
				She lookd back on her Bed to see, whether her body <lb/>
				was gone too but she saw it behind, and thought Its <lb/>
				no matter, I shall get it once ag<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>. When she awoke <lb/>
				they saw she was extraordinary chearfull &amp; happy and <lb/>
				the meditation on this dream made herforget the Pain <lb/>
				and strengthned he wonderfully. and several other <lb/>
				pretty dreams she had, at times, that are to long to insert <lb/>
					here).

				All her neighbours, relations &amp; acquaintance came to see her <lb/>
				in her Sickness, and were suprized at her Chearfullness and <lb/>
				Confidence in our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; went away much affected, testi- <lb/>
				fying that she certainly was a happy woman. Her <lb/>
				Land Lord having been to See her, said: She is a Sheep, <lb/>

				Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Nearness sweet &amp; precious in all her pain, &amp; that she was <lb/>
				as a poor needy Sinner reconciled &amp; her heart wished for his <lb/>

				soon. Among many sweet Verses her minnd fed upon, she <lb/>
					was a this time peculiarly charmed with this:
