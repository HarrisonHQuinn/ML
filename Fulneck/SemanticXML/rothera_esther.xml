					<placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName>.
				</p>
			<p>
				Our happily deceased <roleName type="honorific">Sister</roleName>, was <name relation="child">Daughter</name> to <persName cert="high" type="real">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James
<lb/>
Farrer</persName> in <placeName cert="high">Soyland</placeName>, in the Parish of <placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName> where she <lb/>
				was born <date calendar="Julian" when="1760-02-02" cert="high">Febr 2<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> 1706 O.S</date>. and brought up in the <lb/>
				principles of the <orgName religion="Anglican">Church of England</orgName> in a carefull and <lb/>
					religious manner.
				</p>
			<p>
				The following <add place="above">is her own</add> account (of her was noted down by her <lb/>
					<persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> Joshua Metcalf</persName> from her own mouth:)
				</p>
			<p>
				"When I was <date cert="medium" when="1714">8 Years old</date>, I can remember, that I was <lb/>
				weary about the Salvation of my Soul. I felt the <lb/>
				drawings of my <roleName type="honorific">Saviour</roleName> in my heart (and thought <lb/>
				the <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName> meant to shew me something more than <lb/>
				the rest of my <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> </orgName> or even any of my kindred). <lb/>
				<date cert="medium" when="1719">About the Age of 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> </date> I was made more sensible of <lb/>
				the Corruption of my nature and convinced that I <lb/>
				was not right, but how to find Rest for my heart <lb/>
				I knew not. My guilty conscience made me evry <lb/>
				where afraid. I often thought the grand Enemy of <lb/>
				Souls was in the room with me, and was so frighted <lb/>
				that I would not sleep alone in a room so that <lb/>
				they were obliged to take me into that of my Father <lb/>
				and Mother. My Father departed this LIfe soon <lb/>
				after, and When <date cert="medium" when="1721">I was 15 Years old</date> I was turnd <lb/>
				into the World to earn my own Bread. My Mo- <lb/>
				ther would not let me live in a publik Town, <lb/>
				she had a concern for my Soul, and thought it <lb/>
				was too dangerous for young people. I went <lb/>
				therefore to live with a Widow Woman in the Country <lb/>
				and stayd with her near 2 Years. One of my <lb/>
				Sisters sent afterwards for me and desired me <lb/>
				to come and live with her, which I did. Ha- <lb/>

				Having been with her some Years I returned and soon <lb/>
					after went to live at <placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName>. <del>Being now</del>
				<add place="above">When I was</add> <date cert="medium" when="1731">25 <lb/>
				Years</date> old I got a fresh Call from my dear <roleName type="honorific">Lord</roleName>, I <lb/>
				saw my sad wretched and dismal State, which I <lb/>
				was in by nature, with more conviction and distress. <lb/>
				I had no rest in my Soul by reason of my Sins. They <lb/>
				increased and the depravity of nature grew <lb/>
				stronger &amp; stronger. I made one promise after the <lb/>
				other, took one resolution after the other to leave off doing <lb/>
				Evil and to mend my manner of Life, but all to no <lb/>
				purpose. My good will came to nought. Alas! I had no <lb/>
				power in myself, Nature ruled, Sin was my Master, <lb/>
					and I was a perfect Slave.
				</p>
			<p>
				In my <date cert="medium" when="1733">27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Year</date> I changed my condition &amp; was <name event="marriage" when-iso="1733">married</name> <lb/>
				to my husband <persName cert="high" type="real">Crispin Rothera</persName>. I hoped thereby to be <lb/>
				delivered out of dangers, and <del>that</del> to become more religious <lb/>
				But this availed nothing neither, I was conscious that I <lb/>
				was not in a State of heart that could please <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>. My <lb/>
				poor Soul had no rest. I often knew not what to do for <lb/>
				trouble of mind and <name emotion="anxiety">Anxiety</name> <name emotion="of heart">of heart</name>. Certainly, thought <lb/>
				I, there is no rest and <name emotion="comfort">Comfort</name> to be found in any state <lb/>
				whatsoever, that I can see into, as yet. O thought I, <lb/>
				what a dismal condemned Situation am I in, having <lb/>
				no rest in my heart by day <del>n</del>or night. I went con- <lb/>
				stantly to Church, and Prayers, read religious books &amp; <lb/>
					did all I could, but remained the same, as I was.
					At Length I got to hear, that a new Preacher, One</p>
			<p>					<persName ref="#mlper000536" cert="high" type="real">M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Ingham</persName>, was to come to <placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName> &amp; <del>to</del> preach in <lb/>
				the Church. Him I went to hear, his preaching confir- <lb/>
				med me in my thoughts, that I was in a lost and un- <lb/>
				done Condition, which he set forth as I found it in <lb/>
				my own heart. I went home full of uneasiness of mind, <lb/>
				and condemned in heart, retired into a place by myself  <lb/>

				fell down upon my knees in order to pray, but <lb/>
				could do nothing but Sigh. My heart was quite broken, <lb/>
				and I wept abundance of tears. How I felt then I <lb/>
				cannot express in Words. I got some <name emotion="comfort">comfort</name> and <lb/>
				hoped it would go better. But I found however no <lb/>
					abiding rest and Satisfaction for my heart.</p>
			<p>					A little time after I got to hear that some Germans or as <lb/>
				others called them <orgName religion="Moravian Church">Moravian Brethren</orgName> came to preach in <lb/>
				<placeName cert="high">Hallifax</placeName>. They brought us the sweet &amp; <name emotion="comfortable">comfortable</name> Tidings <lb/>
				of the Salvation of Sinners thro' the Sufferings &amp; Death <lb/>
				of <persName type="real" cert="high">Jesus</persName>, inviting the poor and miserable to come just <lb/>
				as they were to their wounded <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> and seek for <lb/>
				Grace at his feet, <add place="above">declaring that</add> he had redeemed us and would freely <lb/>
					save us from Sin, &amp; give rest to our Souls.</p>
			<p>					Their Words came with power to my heart, I rejoiced <lb/>
				at this good News, and got hopes that he would have <lb/>
				Mercy on me poor miserable Sinner. I frequented <lb/>
				their <name event="religious">Meetings</name> as often as my poor State of health <lb/>
				would permit. When I went the very first time <lb/>
				to <placeName ref="#mlpla000065" cert="high">Smithhouse</placeName> to a <name event="religious">Meeting</name> there (and came on the <lb/>
					Bank Top,) I was thrown <add place="above">from</add>
				<del>by</del> the horse. I thought <lb/>
				within myself, this is the Enemys Doing, to keep me <lb/>
				back and to hinder me from going. I went however <lb/>
				forward, (and desired those that were with me, not <lb/>
				to tell my husband or others of it, lest he should <lb/>
				hinder me to go again.) <name health="disease">I was a quarter of a Year
<lb/>
sick afterwards</name>. The more I heard the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> </orgName> the more <lb/>
				I saw the deep Corruption of my heart, being of a <lb/>
				proud, passionate temper, and inclined to be selfrightious. I resolved to be our Saviours with Soul &amp; <lb/>
				body, and parted with whatsoever I thought would <lb/>
				prove a hindrance to my happiness, and step in <lb/>
				betwixt me and our <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi></roleName>. I used to spin worsted <lb/>
				and had saved the bits of Ends now &amp; then to <lb/>

				This I looked upon as an Injustice by w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> I had wronged <lb/>
				the Master. It caused me much Uneasiness. I could not <lb/>
				be satisfied, till I had confessed it to the Owner and made <lb/>
				Satisfaction. He looked upon it as an instance of great <lb/>
					honesty and had ever after a great respect for me.</p>
			<p>					I thought, whosoever will be reconciled unto <persName type="real" cert="high">God</persName>, must also re-  <lb/>
					ctify all unjust things between Man &amp; Man.

				defamatory Libels or reasoning ag<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> </orgName> did not shake <lb/>

				peculiar people and rejoiced that she had the Grace <lb/>
				to be a member of the same. She often said to those <lb/>

				"The <orgName religion="Moravian Church">B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> </orgName> will stand and all those that are against them will <lb/>

				grieved abt it and said: "Tho she loved her husband very <lb/>

				Their house was open for the <orgName religion="Moravian Church">Brn</orgName> at all times, and she <lb/>
				<del>their</del> thought it a <name emotion="great blessing">great Blessing</name> if they would put <lb/>

				had an opporutnity of conversing with any one abt  <lb/>
				our d<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <roleName type="honorific">Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> and his Wounds. Many of her Neighbours <lb/>

				Those abt her said: It would be of no Effect, she would do no <lb/>

				this proved to be the last time. (When <persName ref="#mlper000328" cert="high" type="real">B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </persName> &amp; <persName cert="high" type="real"><roleName type="honorific">S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> </roleName> Pyrlaus</persName> was <lb/>

				Some months ago, when she thought that this her <name health="disease">present Illness</name> <lb/>
