							<l>Lindsey House Nov<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1754.</l>
						</lg>
					</p>
					<p> After the remains of our dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish were intred, the B<hi
							rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
						<lb/> (among whom where many from London) met in the Family Hall <lb/> in
						Lindsey House and then was Sung that Hymn: O Head so full of  <lb/>Bruises
						&amp; After which the Disciple spoke in English as follows. </p>
					<p> I have but a few words to say on this Occasion, the Liturgy of to <lb/> Day belongs to the
						Evening when our Saviour went from us, the pre <lb/> sent Day has besides
						that, the particular character of all Saints, &amp; that <lb/> gives me a
						handle to speak something of the Saints, &amp; of the nature of a Saint.
						<lb/> &apos;Tis a name quite common in the Bible, and if we hear of a good
						Man <lb/> who left the World 2, or 300 Years ago, then we have not much
						against <lb/> his appearing in that Character, and are not shock&apos;d by
						it, <lb/> but the Ideas we have form&apos;d to ourselves of a Saint are
						such, that <lb/> in the Romish Church itself no body can be called so, till
						1000 <lb/> Years after his Departure. The reason is because one fears, <lb/>
						if any one should remain who had seen that Man or <lb/> Woman he would
						Controul his Sanctity, he would <lb/> say something that would lesson his
						Opinion of his Wor- <lb/>thiness. I am sure one is greatly mistaken in this
						Respect, <lb/> but as we are calld to promote the Sinnership we <lb/> are
						not so Curious to receive that Name, Saint, we <lb/> care not if that
						Charactor should be heard of no more <lb/> but for all that I would not have
						it, that we shou&apos;d <lb/> loose the meaning of the Thing together with
						the name <lb/> Title &amp; Charactor, &amp; should we prove careless in that
						point <lb/> I Fear we should be deprived of a great Charactor in the Gos-
						<lb/> pel Train. A Saint in my Opinion is a Christian, <lb/> who thinks very
						little, who perhaps may be oblig&apos;d to <note>think</note></p>

					<p> think of many things on Account of his Business &amp; of his <lb/> Office, but when I say
						he thinks not much, I mean that he <lb/> does not care to think much,
						according to the Inclination <lb/> of his Heart. You will scarcely find a
						Saint among the great <lb/> Men, the Rich &amp; learn&apos;d Men, perhaps
						not among the Gen <lb/> try, or what one calls an easy Person in this World,
						the rea <lb/> son is, because all such charge themselves with too ma <lb/>
						ny Superfluities, while the necessary condition of becoming <lb/> a Saint,
						is not to have a great Store of Idle &amp; unnecessa <lb/> ry things about
						him. Simplicity &amp; plainness is the Distin <lb/> guishing, mark of a
						Saint. I confess that if a Person <lb/> of that Character, happens to want
						Education &amp; of <lb/> Course what one calls all manner of required
						Qualities <lb/> hath absoludely not so much notion of the World, as <lb/> to
						deal in an ordinary Way, in a regular Way, then the <lb/> Sanctity of such a
						Man, may not comand that Honour <lb/> that Awe, that Reverence which is due
						to it as long as he <lb/> lives, &amp; it Seems therefore, that I should be
						afraid to tell <lb/> you now by way of Discourse, what I have already Sung
						<lb/> of my B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Larish, whom I always thought a
						Saint &amp; <lb/> I beleive there are 100 in the Cattalouge on Dypticks of
						old, <lb/> who were by far not his paramounts, not like him, nor so <lb/>
						much of a Saint as He. He was a Person void of all <lb/> manner of
						Education, he had been neglected in all the <lb/> Necessary things of this
						Life, &amp; after having found the <lb/> Secret, to make himself to be
						forgotten in this World, after <note>having</note>
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p> having placed himself behind the Congregation at Hhuth, in <lb/> order to lead a Simple
						Civil Life, &amp; absolutely not regard <lb/> ed by any one, which he
						contriv&apos;d so out of a true Humility, <lb/> for He was a Lord, &amp; had
						then many Subjects, &amp; a great <lb/> Territory of his own. When he was in
						that Situation <lb/> he came hither, and met with one of the most Difficult
						<lb/> Tasks which can be imagin&apos;d, nevertheless he atcheiv&apos;d &amp;
						per <lb/> formd it with such surprising Simplicity &amp; wisdom, that <lb/>
						I cant help owning once more, that I should have been <lb/> embarrass&apos;d
						in the highest degree to do the like: And I must add <lb/> that if after my
						Decease one would compare me to that great <lb/> Man, &amp; my Conduct to
						his many Personal Circumstances, as <lb/> well as real Intricacies, which
						would be too long to relate <lb/> here (the Saviour knows them, &amp; part
						of us are not Igorant <lb/> thereof,) it would be mere Courtesey. B<hi
							rend="superscript">r</hi>. Larish fullfill&apos;d <lb/> his Task with
						Honour, &amp; has not left one leaf of his Book <lb/> unfinish&apos;d. His
						end was like to that of all truly great Men, a <lb/> little while before he
						had not the least thought of going home <lb/> he was Sick, &amp; a very long
						time knew his sase almost incurable <lb/> but drew no Consequence from it
						for in approaching Dissolution. <lb/> When he was acquainted of the Turn his
						Sickness had taken <lb/> &amp; of the approaching Dissolution, &apos;twas
						very well, &apos;twas <lb/> all the same to him. Those Days passed away in
						the same <lb/> Strain as the foregoing. He treated that awful matter as
						simple <lb/> Natural &amp; unconcerndly fill the last gasp as usual, that
						<lb/> none of the Heroes of this world, nore of the great Geniuses <lb/>
						needed to be asham&apos;d of the same Exit, Considering the thing in
							<note>itself</note></p>

							itself &amp; without that difference, which makes his case so
							much happier than theirs, as for that, He will never
							change his Exit for that of any Hero of this World, of
							any great man or Philosopher whatsoever that is quite
							out of Question, all I have to say on that part is,
							that he departed this Life like a Hero.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Every one enabled from above to see the hidden Side
							of things, their real Charactor to extricate the real
							point out of appearances, will never Contradict my opinion, about his abode here, having been like his Departure
							I wish with all my Heart, that so many brave B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>
							so many wise ones so many well Educated, so many truly

							had not the good fortune to have known him personally

							<hi rend="underline">Next follows some Account of his Life &amp; Departure</hi>
							Our dear B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Charles Henry Conrad von Parish, was born
							Sept 22<hi rend="superscript">nd</hi> 1711 in Gradenwiz near Cosel in upper Silesia. He
							was descended from the Ancient Famous Family of the Courts
							&amp; Lords of Larish, also of the Lineage of great Nimsdorff
							<add place="above">one</add> of whom, in the Service of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> is already a grain of
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							Wheat in Surinam. He inherited from his parents the Lordships of Shossloehiz Lomniz Zonade &amp; Rodewiz. In his
							tender Youth he became acquainted with Abbot Steinmez &amp; other Servants of God, by means of the well known great Justness awakening, &amp; he was concern&apos;d about his Salvation very
							much, this continued for some time, &amp; on this account he staid awhile in <del>Neustad</del>
								<add place="above">Mandel</add> with Abbot Steinmetz, was at Werningrode
							Halle &amp; other Places, where he thought perhaps he might get a
							Blessing for his Heart. Since 1731 he has been acquainted
							with the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> as well in Jena as in other Places &amp; came
							from time to time to Visit the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in Hhuth, where the
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> came ever nearer to his Heart. He found no true rest
							from all his good Performance, nor was delivered from his Anxiety till he resolv&apos;d in the Year 1739 to become the intire
							Reward of the Smart of Jesus, at the same time he got
							a Conviction to let every thing be as it was, &amp; to betake himself to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> to stay there; accordingly he did so, with
							a true Blessing for his Heart, &amp; he had at that time truely blessed times for his Heart with the Single Br<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> assisted also quite faithfully in Building their Choir House
							there. He was also soon received into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; partook
							of the Corps &amp; Blood of Jesus in the Sacrament with
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							In May 1742, He came over to Engl. were he staid for some
							time especially in Yorks<add place="above">hire</add> &amp; was edifying to the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> in his
							Servants office in the Hall which he perform&apos;d very faithfully

							faithfully &amp; with his whole Heart from thence he returned in company with the Dr Disciple &amp; Mother to Holland &amp; so on to
							M-born &amp; was there May 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1743. Married to our S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Diana
							Raymond after his marriage her his Wife were 1<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> Deacons
							in Engl &amp; conducted it with true Simplicity &amp; many Blesssings afterwards he made Several Journeys to Hhuth &amp;
							Hhaag, in this Year also he visited his Lordships &amp; found himself not only not in a Capacity to execute what he had intended, but found also such an Entanglement in his worldly
							Affairs, that he thought it best to sell his Estates, to pay
							he Debts, &amp; to give the rest to the Diaconate of the Enity
							which at that time was much streighten&apos;d, for wch in the
							Year 1740 the New House calld Lichtenburg was made over to 
							him &amp; fitted up, but because his comfort did not like to tarry
							at Hhaag, he went with her first to Zyest &amp; in the last
							Year again to Engl; &amp; enjoyed by his abode in each Place of
							those Cong<hi rend="superscript">ns</hi> much Grace &amp; Blessings for his Heart, &amp; all
							the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> &amp; S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> lov&apos;d him, he had a longer attachment &amp; faithful
							Heart full of love to our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> &amp; his Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; amidst the various Circumstances w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> his weak constitution mostly occasi-
							ond. He was never put off from his point, but his Heart always long&apos;d after him, whom he can now see bodily &amp; kiss his
							Wounds.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							The latter Years of his mortal Life he was very Sickly &amp; had
							many disorders in his Body, but especially since the Winter
							53 yet as long as it was possible he came to the Opportunities
							in the Disciples House very diligently &amp; with great Chearfullness
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							cheerfulness. According to the Nature of His Disease and frequent casaulties of all sorts He thought nothing at first of going home, till just
							after his Birthday this year when the Watchword was untill the
							glance extend throughout &amp; then he came upon it very happily
							himself, and he was heard to say when by <del>by</del> himself, to our
							Saviour: My Dear Saviour be thou my all in all &amp; round about me, I am indeed weak, but thou knowest well how to make,
							it better, and he said: I am indeed spent or very weak, but I
							shall soon go into the Regions of health. Another time, when
							he was in great pain he comforted himself with the sufferings
							of our Saviour, &amp; rejorced at the sweet hour of his release, &amp;
							only wish&apos;d that our Saviour wo&apos;d take him to himself in
							sleep. As he pressd very much to have all his Temporal affairs
							concerning him and his regulated while he was here, therefore
							the Synodal Conclusion of 1753, was thro&apos; the interposition
							of the Disciples House but a few days before his end in
							the name of our God brought into the form customary
							here, and tho&apos; all the necessary forms are yet wanting from both
							the Married parties, yet the Deed is delivered to the satisfaction of all sides. Oct 26 He got a new disorder &amp; said: that now
							he was ready to waite for the last kiss, when the Brn at his
							desire sung him some verses he rejoyced and said O that
							has strengthned me, &amp; so continued in continual thought
							of going home till the 28 of Octo<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> when he said: to this Servant Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Summerskill, this Ev&apos;ning or Tomorrow
							morning the expected hour will <add place="above">come</add> &amp; often asked, is it not yet
							time he sent also 2 or 3 times in the night for B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Johan

							to come and bless him, and when Joh came to him, and sung: pale
							Lips kiss him upon the Heart, he said; o yes, and to that Verse and
							when thy Mouth expiring &amp;c. He said even to Day.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						
							Oct 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Towards Morning he took leave of his Wife and said:
							My dear I kiss thee on thy Heart, here I have been thy Husband and thy Heart, we was both one Body but now no
							more, I an going to our dear Saviour and shall expect
							thee with my Bridegroom with Joy: Afterwards he
							said to B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Summerskill and his Wife, my dear Children forgive me every thing and I thank you for all the Love and
							faithfulness that you shew&apos;d me here and the B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> will think
							on you for it, thereupon he said to his Maid (who is no
							Sister) adue I thank you also for all you have done for me, I
							wish you well in the World, about Six o&apos;Clock in the 
							Morning he desired Brother John<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> to be called
							again, because he was very weak but recover&apos;d himself as soon as he saw him w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>
							he did several times before; The rest of the
							Time he was mostly as if he was asleep, &amp; had thereby sometimes such an
							extraordinary lovely &amp; smiling look
							that the eyes of the Brethren &amp; Sisters
							round about him overflowed. Hutton
							said once, such a look is worth more
						
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>
						
							than 100 Guineas, at last he awoke, rais&apos;d
							himself and said to Brother Johannes
							now Bless me, &amp; then he took his hand &amp;
							laid it himself upon his forehead, &amp;
							so Johannes Blessed him with that
							Verse: &amp; let his Mouth expiring on
							thy dear Breast recline &amp;c. to
							which our dear happy heart said yes
							powerfully: Ater the Blessing
							he look&apos;d about once more, when
							he saw Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Johannes, Wallerville
							Hutton &amp; others standing round
							him, he threw them a kiss, &amp; said:
							<add place="above">Fare you well</add> Adue sweetly the holy Ghost has

							thy committed to him many Salutations <add place="above">&amp; kisses</add> to the Saviour and

							the Church above made perfect
							&amp; perticularly our dear Blessed
							Christle, and he promissd it 
							with a plain Yes. His last
							Words were: We all live unto
							him &amp; then he shut his eyes
							again and slept &amp; so according to his wish his Spirit was
							kiss&apos;d away in Sleep &amp; the Brn
							&amp; Sisters round him <add place="above">sung him</add> quite into

							a very happy look with which
