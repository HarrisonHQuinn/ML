							This is a memoir of <lb />
							S S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>. Elizt Claggett. 
						</p>
					<p>
							She has left in her Choir house a good odour behind her, <lb />
							so that those who were acquainted with <del>her</del>, and had an <lb />
							opportunity to converse with her, will always retain a <lb />
							blessed remembrance of the grace which our dear <lb />
							Lord had bestowed upon her. 
						</p>
					<p>
							Tho&apos; she has not, for some time past, frequent<hi rend="superscript">ed</hi> the meetings <lb />
							on acct of her disorder, yet it was remarkable that she <lb />
							always had a feeling &amp; partook <add place="above">of</add> those blessings which <lb />
							were enjoyed by the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> or her Choir, and would speak <lb />
							of it to the S<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> as if she had been in the meeting.
						</p>
					<p>
							Some <del>short</del> time before her dissolution, her peculiar <lb />
							disposition, namely a shyness to see or speak w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> any but <lb />
							a few particular friends, went to an extreme, but <lb />
							this served to her greater humiliation, and she became <lb />
							so loving, that she could not sufficiently express her <lb />
							gratitude, love &amp; thankfulness to all about her, <lb />
							often repeating: I love &amp; think you, I love &amp; thank <lb />
							you all. and desired often those who came to her to <lb />
							kiss her. It was a great pleasure to be with her in <lb />
							her last days, the Serenity &amp; happiness of her heart, not- <lb />
							withstanding her great pains, made her sick room <lb />
							pleasant, tho her disorder would else have been very <lb />
							disagreeable to the outw<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> senses of those who came into <lb />
							the room. At last, her long &amp; ardent wish to be dissolved <lb />
							and with our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> came happily to pass on the 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> <lb />
							Inst; with a sensible feeling of her Bridegroom&apos;s <lb />
							Nearess, &amp; w<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> the blessd of her Choir in the 52<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Yr of <lb />
							her age.

							I was born in Yorkshire in the year 1715 where I staid with my <lb />
							Mothers Relations till the year 20 in which my Mother came &amp; fetch&apos;d me <lb />
							to London. I remember to have head some Influences of Grace even in my <lb />
							Infant years, but when I was about 14 Years of age, I came under strong <lb />
							Convictions. in the rights I was sometimes so terrified, that I thought I <lb />
							realy heard the Trumpet give the Signal of our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> coming to Judgment. <lb />
							I believed I shou&apos;d be in the Number of those who would call on the Rocks <lb />
							&amp; mountains to cover them. I made repeated Resolutions of devoting my fu- <lb />
							ture life if God shou&apos;d spare me a little longer, to his Service. I began to be <lb />
							pretty diligent in Prayer, both publick &amp; private, &amp; in the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of my Age <lb />
							having now read in Invitation from one of my Aunts in Yorkshire a religi- <lb />
							ous woman, to go &amp; stay some Time with her; having first intreated the Lord <lb />
							with many Tears, that he wou&apos;d direct this affair, I ask&apos;d &amp; obtaind leave of <lb />
							my Father &amp; Mother to go. She encouraged &amp; instructed me as will as she <lb />
							could, which I prosicuted in my way, but was never satisfied. when I <lb />
							was 17 years old, I went to the Sacrament in the Church of England, for the <lb />
							first Time. I was near 19 years old when I returnd back to London, where <lb />
							I still continued a kind of religious course, but the Gayeties and Divertions of <lb />
							the Town, strongly took hold of my Heart, till in my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year, when I got such <lb />
							a sense of the total Depravity of my nature, that I believ&apos;d the very marrow of <lb />
							my Bones was <add place="above">infected</add> with sin. I had never heard of any ones being awakend <lb />
							nor did I know there was such a Thing; so I concluded there was not another <lb />
							such vile wretch existing as my self. I got various Books of Devotion <lb />
							but cou&apos;d not use any of them; so I concluded they were not calculated for <lb />
							such a Creature as I. I then betook myself to David&apos;s Psalms, &amp; from thence <lb />
							collected sentences &amp; to Compild Prayers which express&apos;d the Language of my <lb />
							Heart. I often fell prostrate on the Floor &amp; with Floods of Tears, lamented <lb />
							my wretched state; some-Times I had a Glimmering of hope; these words often <lb />
							aleviated my distress &quot;perfect Love casts out Fear, for Fear hath Tor- <lb />
							ment, to which my heart answerd &quot;Yes Lord, that Fear hath Torment I know <lb />
							very well, if there be a Love which casts it out, bestow it upon me. <lb />
							another Text also was much in my mind; Except ye eat the Flesh of the <lb />
							Son of man &amp; drink his blood ye have no Life in you: to which my Heart <lb />
							replied &quot;where shall I get this Blood? Why in the Sacrament, but that I dare <lb />
							not partake of lest I eat &amp; drink my own Damnation. (I had intirely left <lb />
							off going to the Sacrament, since I came to a sense of my Sinful Nature). <lb />
							One Day meditating about that Blood, I resolved on a Saints day to go to <lb />
							St Lawrances Church, &amp; by when I come there if I cou&apos;d venture to go to the <lb />
							Sacrament, I chose that Place rather than my own Parish Church, for my Friends <lb />
							&amp; acquaintance already thought I was out of my Senses, so I concealed every Thing <lb />
							which had the appearance of Religion as much as I could. accordingly I went to <lb />
							the above mentioned Church: after the first Service I remained dubious whether <lb />
							I shou&apos;d stay the Sacrament or not; I then opend my common Prayer Book on <lb />
							these Words of the Psalms, &quot;unto the wicked faith God, why dost thou teach <lb />
							my Laws or take my Covenant into thy mouth. with this I was quite stund &amp; <lb />
							thus I went directly <del>out of the Church</del> home, &amp; then to my chamber, where I <lb />
							fell prostrate, &amp; silently pourd forth Streams of Tears. I went on in a <lb />
							disconsolate Solitary way conversing but little with any one; at length I con- <lb />
							tracted some acquaintance with an old women who was a Presbyterian <lb />
							She some-Times spoke words of Consolation to me, tho&apos; I afterwards believ&apos;d <lb />
							she herself did not understand them. In my 22<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year, during the Passion Week

							week I enjoid a particular serenity of mind. being wearied of my own strive <lb />
							ings, &amp; finding my last Resolutions to be but vain; I steid my self in some mea- <lb />
							sure upon Grace &amp; Mercy, hopeing it might extend even to me. in this week <lb />
							I visited that Woman, I told for of my desire to go to the Sacrament, &amp; also <lb />
							related my Scruples, the encouraged me to venture, saying I shou&apos;d thereby <lb />
							get strength &amp; nourishment to pursue my future course. I thought tho&apos; <lb />
							our Sav<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>would not accept of me before, perhaps he will now; so I con- <lb />
							cluded that if the same stillness &amp; compoture of mind, I then enjoyd <lb />
							continued till Sunday I would venture: it continued, &amp; on Easter Sunday I <lb />
							arose in a calm bowedness of Heart, &amp; went to the early Sacrament <lb />
							which was kept at my own Parish Church. At receiving of the Bread &amp;  <lb />
							Wine, an awe seized one, so that my Hand trembled greatly, which caused <lb />
							the Minnister to stare <del>at stare</del> at me, but the Love, Peace &amp; Joy which <lb />
							in those moments took Possession of my Soul, words cannot express. </p>
					<p>
							I return&apos;d home so chearful lightsome &amp; happy, that it seem&apos;d to me as <lb />
							if I went on Wings. being come Home I met with many Things not very agre- <lb />
							able, but so passionate as I used to be before, now nothing disturbed me; <lb />
							I loved every Body to exceedingly that <add place="above">I thought</add> I could have laid down &amp; let them <lb />
							tread upon one. I long&apos;d to be again at Church out of the Sight &amp; hearing of <lb />
							Earthly Things, to thither I went again at 10 O&apos;Clock, my Heart was in such a <lb />
							desolveing condition that the Tears would now &amp; then Start out of my Eyes, which <lb />
							the People observing, told my Relations that now I was indeed gone out of <lb />
							my senses for I had Wept at Church; which oblig&apos;d me to get a retired Seat <lb />
							among ordinary Old People. In the Nights my Heart would be singing Hosan- <lb />
							as &amp; Hallelujahs, for I knew not right what to sing or say, nor what had hap- <lb />
							pen&apos;d to me; other Things as well as my self seemd alterd, &amp; the Scriptures <lb />
							as if I had never read them before, but for all this I had Times of Hea- <lb />
							viness, &amp; if my Feeling was long withdrawn, even of doubting of my Sal- <lb />
							vation. soon after this a poor Woman <add place="above">coming</add>
								<del>came</del> to my Fathers House to begg <lb />
							some relief for her Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> who was ill of a Cancer in her Breast, I had a desire <lb />
							to visit the Sick Person, &amp; accordingly went to her Lodging, there I for the first <lb />
							time saw Bro<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Hutton who was then in his Apprenticeship, &amp; thro&apos; his means I <lb />
							become acqainted with Whitefield Wesleys &amp; others of the Methodists, among <lb />
							whom I continued till in the year 1740 when the Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> began their Labour <lb />
							in England. I knew directly that they were the People for me, since which <lb />
							Time I adhered to them entirely. in June 1742 I went with great Reluctance <lb />
							but in compliance with my Fathers commands to spend the Summer with <lb />
							the rest of our Family at Broadoaks in Essex, I had been there 2 or 3 <lb />
							Weeks when as Sitting alone in my Room, our Savr presented himself to <lb />
							my Heart in his bleeding Wounded Form, &amp; brought me into such a converse <lb />
							with his own dear person, as I had never known before, then it was that <lb />
							my heart went over to Him, then I was willing to live any where, or be any <lb />
							Thing what might be most pleasing to him. His Blood his Death &amp; Almigh- <lb />
							ty Atonement has since that blest Intercouse, remaind my neverfailing <lb />
							Source of Comfort &amp; Consolation, in all Trials &amp; Vicissitudes whatsoever. <lb />
							his Wounds &amp; bitter Passion, his Death was my confession, &amp; shall be <lb />
							till my Eye-Strings break. The Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> rejoied much at my return to <lb />
							London at all the Grace our dear Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> had bestowed on me. In June 1742 <lb />
							my Father having departed this Life, I went by the Direction of the
					</p>
					<cb />
					<p>						
							Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> &amp; Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> to the Childrens Oeconomy in Lambs-Inn, where I <lb />
							lived with the bigger Girls. Oct<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> I returnd to London, &amp; on the <lb />
							30<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of the some Instant, that ever memorable day, I was present at the <lb />
							settling of the London Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>: what we felt at that time I suppose will by <lb />
							no Body be forgot who was there till beyond the Grave, I thought, this is <lb />
							none other but the House of God, &amp; here are the Gates of Heaven! There <lb />
							I got my incontestable Call, to be visibly united to that Body. on <lb />
							the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> day next following, I was rec&apos;d (viz) on Christmass Day  <lb />
							1743, &amp; had the Favour of being admitted to the <del>Sacrament</del> next follow- <lb />
							ing Sacrament, which I think to have been Jan. 1743.
						</p>
					<p>
							I assisted in the Labour amongst the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> in London according <lb />
							to my Small abillity till June 1743 where I was sent by the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> into <lb />
							Yorkshire, to have the joint Care of the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Choir there with <lb />
							my Sister Susanna &amp; Sister Lloid. In June 1744 I was blest for the <lb />
							Office of Vorestehr of the said Choir, &amp; in Aug<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> following, I rec&apos;d the <lb />
							blessing for the office I afterwards held amongst the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi>, during <lb />
							every anointed Prayer of Bror Martin Dobers. In that situation I continued <lb />
							till my state of health render&apos;d me incapable of serving my dear Sisters <lb />
							as I had hithertoo done; I then sent my Petitions to dear Mammagen <lb />
							&amp; Anna Johanna to send a Sis<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> from Germany to supply my Place <lb />
							which was at length granted in the year 1748 to the entire satisfac <lb />
							tion of my Heart. I laid down my Office at our Sav<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Feet with <lb />
							more Inclination than I had at first to receive it, <add place="above">being now more unable to fulfill it</add> yet awefully con- <lb />
							ciding how he might have look&apos;d upon my poor services; and if his <lb />
							Heart cou&apos;d upon the whole be satisfied with them? His friendly Counte- <lb />
							nance cheard me, I begd his absolation for all my Faults Failings, <lb />
							&amp; Mistakes, &amp; thus with a throughly comforted &amp; contented Heart I <lb />
							enterd into my wish&apos;d for Sabbatick State, I was desirious to go to <lb />
							the then now settled Oeconomy at little-moor, hopeing a charge of air <lb />
							might be of Service to me where I continued near a year, &amp; realy <lb />
							did grow a little better, having rec&apos;d a Letter from my dear Mammagen <lb />
							(who was not quite satisfied with my betakeing any self wholy to sick <lb />
							ness &amp; Retirement) wherein she mentiond in the most loving &amp; kind <lb />
							manner, that she shou&apos;d like to have me go to Duckenfield &amp; do what <lb />
							I could amongst the Single Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> there: I laid the matter before our <lb />
							Sav<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>, &amp; found that notwithstanding the seeming Impossibillity of my <lb />
							performing the Journey, my heart was never easey, but when I thought <lb />
							of going: thus I came to a Resolution, &amp; having had a blessed Journey <lb />
							I arrived there May 1749: from whence I return&apos;d with the whole <lb />
							Oeconomy of Sis<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Sept<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1750. The Bre<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> favour&apos;d
								me <lb />
							with one of the Houses on Lambs-Hill, where I lived <lb />
							chearful &amp; contented only in an exceeding poor state of Health <lb />
							till Feb<hi rend="superscript">ry</hi> 27<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1753 when I come into the dear Choir-House.
