					The single S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Martha Calvert who <lb />
					departed this life March 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1816, <lb />
					has left the following short account, <lb />
					which she dictated Sept 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1813. <lb />
					I was born Oct 19th 1743 in Idle, <lb />
					in my 3<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> year I moved with my <lb />
					parents into Pudsey, they belonging <lb />
					to the B<hi rend="superscript">rns</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> as soon as I <lb />
					was old enough took me to the  <lb />
					Childrens meeting, where I remem- <lb />
					ber as a very little Child being <lb />
					told to pray to our Saviour to  <lb />
					wash our hearts in his blood, <lb />
					and when I came home, I  <lb />
					often went into a corner, and <lb />
					repeated these words as well as <lb />
					I could. March 25<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1756 I  <lb />
					was added to the great Girls Choir, <lb />
					which day proved a great blessing <lb />
					to me, and from that time I  <lb />
					felt an earnest desire to come to  <lb />
					live in Fulnek, this favour was

					granted to me May 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> 1759. I  <lb />
					was now very happy and comfort- <lb />
					able, felt quite at home, and  <lb />
					thought I wanted nothing more. <lb />
					The 13<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Nov. the same year I <lb />
					was rec&apos;d into the Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> with 26 <lb />
					others; having made no previous  <lb />
					application for this favour, I  <lb />
					was much struck when my name <lb />
					was read in the Caple, but I  <lb />
					prayed fervently to our Saviour <lb />
					that his aim might be obtained <lb />
					with me. Jan. 18<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1760 I was  <lb />
					spectator at the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> from <lb />
					this time till the 29<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> of Aug. <lb />
					the same year, when I had the  <lb />
					favour to enjoy this sacramental <lb />
					food for the first time, was a  <lb />
					period which I shall never forget, <lb />
					when I learned to know my own  <lb />
					depravity and sinfulness, and our <lb />
					Saviour manifested himself to 
			</p>
					<p>
				
					my heart in a particular manner as <lb />
					my Redeemer. I learned to know <lb />
					that without him I could do nothing, <lb />
					which proved a good and holesome <lb />
					School to me, and after this I  <lb />
					went on for sometime in a hap- <lb />
					py course. In my 21<hi rend="superscript">st</hi> year, B<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> <lb />
					Nitshman spoke individually with  <lb />
					our whole Choir, it has always been <lb />
					impressed on my mind how fer- <lb />
					vently he recommended me to our <lb />
					Saviour. After the Synod in 1764 <lb />
					was a very searching time in this  <lb />
					Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>, which was also to me of great <lb />
					importance, I sensibly felt how <lb />
					short I fell of what I ought to <lb />
					be, which humbled me at the Lords <lb />
					feet to seek grace and pardon, and  <lb />
					when the whole Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> had missed <lb />
					the H. Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> for 3 successive  <lb />
					times, the feeling which pervaded <lb />
					us all when we again had the

					favour to meet at the Lords table <lb />
					words cannot express. To say much <lb />
					more concerning my pilgrimage <lb />
					here below, I am not able, nor <lb />
					has any thing very striking accur- <lb />
					red, my Saviour has dealt <del>has</del> <lb />
					with me as a kind and tender <lb />
					Father, lead me on by degrees <lb />
					as I was able to bear it, and  <lb />
					kept his faithful hand over me <lb />
					in many trying hours of temptation. <lb />
					When I therefore now look back <lb />
					how I have spent my time, my <lb />
					only plea is; &quot;God be merciful to <lb />
					me a sinner.&quot; I find abundent <lb />
					cause to thank and adore my kind <lb />
					Redeemer for all his love and faith <lb />
					fulness towards me in every respect; <lb />
					in my imply he has blessed me <lb />
					that I have wanted for nothing  <lb />
					and often when I was sweeping <lb />
					the Sleeproom, and being with
			</p>
			<p>
				
					my Saviour alone, I have had many <lb />
					happy hours, when I could simply <lb />
					lay my case before him. Now <lb />
					when I am not able to do any <lb />
					thing, the time will now and then <lb />
					apear long to me, but I pray <lb />
					to him to strenghten my faith and <lb />
					confidence, and to prepare me <lb />
					for his heavenly kingdom, I am <lb />
					very thankful that I am able <lb />
					to attend the meetings, which prove <lb />
					a great comfort and refreshment <lb />
					to my heart. <lb />
					Our late S<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> did not think when  <lb />
					she dictated this, that she still <lb />
					should remain so long in this <lb />
					vale of tears, her patience was <lb />
					often tried, but she prayed earnest <lb />
					ly to the Lord for help and sup <lb />
					port; as long <del>as long</del> as she was <lb />
					able, she faithfully attended the  <lb />
					Chaple, where she found food and

					<p>
				
					nourishment for her hungry soul <lb />
					and with great thankfulness for <lb />
					the blessings she now injoyed <lb />
					she often lamented, that she in <lb />
					former days had not made better <lb />
					use of those priviledges, she often <lb />
					said, that during her late affiliation <lb />
					she was in a close School, where <lb />
					our Saviour by his good spirit <lb />
					pointed out to how many things, <lb />
					which led to deep self examina- <lb />
					tion; and here she experienced <lb />
					now, that he who wounds, can <lb />
					also heal the sins with soul, and <lb />
					speak pardon and peace to the <lb />
					troubled mind, and thanked the <lb />
					Lord with many tears, for what <lb />
					he had done for her. <lb />
					In July last year, she was seized <lb />
					with a paralytick strook, whereby <lb />
					she was deprived of nearly all <lb />
					the use of her limbs, this was
			</p>
					
					<p>

					an other hard trial, but the Lord <lb />
					gave her grace to bear this and  <lb />
					other afflictions with patience, tho&apos;  <lb />
					she often longed for the time to  <lb />
					be with him; she would frequently <lb />
					say, o what happiness awaits me, <lb />
					when I shall see my Saviour face to <lb />
					face, O what endless mercy, that he <lb />
					will receive such a poor and worth <lb />
					sinner as I am. The 12<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> Last. <lb />
					she was according to her desire <lb />
					blessed for her departure and com- <lb />
					mended to the friend of her soul, <lb />
					and the 15<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> early in the morning <lb />
					it pleased our Saviour to call <lb />
					her hence, to rest with him for <lb />
					ever more. Aged 72 years. 5 Months.
