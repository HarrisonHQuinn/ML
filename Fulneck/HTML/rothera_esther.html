      <p> Departed <em>June 2<sup>d</sup> 1761</em><br></br> Personalia of our dear Sister<a href="#mlper000572.html">Esther Rothera</a> in <br></br><a href=".html">Hallifax</a>. </p>
      <p> Our happily deceased Sister, was Daughter to <a href=".html">M<sup>r</sup> James <br></br> Farrer</a> in <a href="#mlpla000373.html">Soyland, in the Parish of Hallifax</a> where she <br></br>
         					was born <em>Febr 2<sup>d</sup> 1706 O.S</em>. and brought up in the <br></br> principles of the Church of England in a carefull and <br></br> religious manner. </p>
      <p> The following <sup>is her own</sup> account (of her was noted down by her <br></br><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Joshua Metcalf</a> from her own mouth:) </p>
      <p> "When I was <em>8 Years old</em>, I can remember, that I was <br></br>weary about the Salvation of my Soul. I felt the <br></br> drawings of my Saviour in my heart (and thought <br></br>
         					the Lord meant to shew me something more than <br></br> the rest of my B<sup>rn</sup> &amp;
         							S<sup>rs</sup> or even any of my kindred). <br></br><em>About the Age of 13<sup>th</sup></em> I was made more sensible of <br></br> the Corruption of my nature and convinced that I <br></br> was not right, but how to find Restfor my heart<br></br> I knew not. My guilty conscience made me evry <br></br> where afraid. I often thought the grand Enemy of <br></br> Souls was in the room with me, and
         					was so frighted<br></br> that I would not sleep alone in a room so that <br></br> they were obliged to take me into that of my Father <br></br> and Mother. My Father departed this Life soon <br></br> after,
         					and When <em>I was 15 Years old</em> I was turnd <br></br> into the World to earn my own Bread. My Mo- <br></br> ther would not let me live in a publik
         					Town, <br></br> she had a concern for my Soul, and thought it <br></br> was too dangerous for young people. I went <br></br> therefore to live with a Widow
         					Woman in the Country <br></br> and stayd with her near 2 Years. One of my <br></br> Sisters sent afterwards for me and desired me <br></br> to come and live
         					with her, which I did. Ha- <br></br></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> Having been with her some Years I returned and soon <br></br> after went to live at <a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>. <del>Being now</del><sup>When I was</sup><em>25 <br></br> Years</em> old I got a fresh Call from my dear Lord, I <br></br> saw my sadwretched and dismal State, which I <br></br> was in by nature, with more conviction and distress. <br></br> I had no rest in my Soul by reason of my Sins. They <br></br> increased and the depravity of nature grew <br></br> stronger &amp;
         					stronger. I made one promise after the <br></br> other, took one resolution after the other to leave off doing <br></br> Evil and to mend my manner of Life, but all to no <br></br> purpose.
         					My good will came to nought. Alas! I had no <br></br> power in myself, Nature ruled, Sin was my Master, <br></br> and I was a perfect Slave. </p>
      <p> In my <em>27<sup>th</sup> Year</em> I changed my condition &amp; was married <br></br> to my
         						husband <a href=".html">Crispin Rothera</a>. I hoped thereby to be <br></br> delivered out of dangers, and
         						<del>that</del> to become more religious <br></br> But this availed nothing neither, I was conscious that I <br></br> was not in a State of heart that could please<a href=".html">God</a>. My <br></br> poor Soul had no rest. I often knew not what to do for <br></br>trouble of mind and Anxietyof heart. Certainly, thought <br></br> I, there is no rest and Comfort to be found in any
         					state <br></br> whatsoever, that I can see into, as yet. O thought I, <br></br> what a dismalcondemned Situation am I in, having <br></br> no restin my heart by day <del>n</del>or night. I went con- <br></br> stantly to Church, and Prayers, read religious books &amp; <br></br> did all I could,
         					but remained the same, as I was. At Length I got to hear, that a new Preacher,
         One</p>
      <p><a href="#mlper000536.html">M<sup>r</sup> Ingham</a>, was to come to <a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>
         					&amp; <del>to</del> preach in <br></br> the Church. Him I went to hear, his preaching confir- <br></br> med me in my thoughts, that I was in a lost and un- <br></br> done Condition, which
         					he set forth as I found it in <br></br> my own heart. I went home full of uneasiness of mind, <br></br> and condemned
         						in heart, retired into a place by myself <br></br></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> fell down upon my knees in order to pray, but <br></br> could do nothing but Sigh. My heart was quite broken,
         					<br></br> and I wept abundance of tears. How I felt then I <br></br> cannot express in Words. I got some comfort and <br></br>hoped it would go better. But I found however no <br></br> abiding rest and Satisfactionfor my heart.</p>
      <p> A little time after I got to hear that some Germans or as <br></br> others called them Moravian Brethren came to preach in <br></br><a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>. They brought us the sweet &amp; comfortable Tidings
         					<br></br> of the Salvation of Sinners thro' the Sufferings &amp; Death <br></br> of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, inviting the
         					poor and miserable to come just <br></br> as they were to their wounded Sav<sup>r</sup> and seek for <br></br>Grace at his feet, <sup>declaring that</sup> he had redeemed us and would freely <br></br> save us from Sin, &amp; give rest to our Souls.</p>
      <p> Their Words came with power to my heart, I rejoiced<br></br> at this good News, and got hopes that he would have <br></br>Mercy on me poor miserable Sinner. I frequented <br></br> their Meetings as often as
         					my poor State of health <br></br> would permit. When I went the very first time <br></br> to <a href="#mlpla000065.html">Smithhouse</a> to a Meeting there (and came on the <br></br> Bank Top,) I was thrown <sup>from</sup><del>by</del> the horse. I thought <br></br> within myself, this is the Enemys Doing, to keep me <br></br> back and to hinder me from going. I went however <br></br> forward, (and desired those that were with me, not <br></br> to tell my husband or others of it, lest he should <br></br> hinder me to go again.) I
         						was a quarter of a Year <br></br> sick afterwards. The more I heard the B<sup>rn</sup> the more <br></br> I saw the deep Corruption of my heart, being of a <br></br>proud, passionatetemper, and inclined to be selfrightious. I resolved to be our Saviours with Soul &amp; <br></br> body, and parted
         					with whatsoever I thought would <br></br> prove a hindrance to my happiness, and step in <br></br> betwixt me and our Sav<sup>r</sup>. I used to spin worsted <br></br> and had saved the bits of Ends now &amp; then to <br></br> make in time a pair of Stockings out of them
         				</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> This I looked upon as an Injustice by w<sup>ch</sup> I had wronged <br></br> the Master. It caused me much Uneasiness. I could not
         					<br></br> be satisfied, till I had confessed it to the Owner and made <br></br>Satisfaction. He looked upon it as an instance of great <br></br> honesty and had ever after a great respect
         					for me.</p>
      <p> I thought, whosoever will be reconciled unto <a href=".html">God</a>, must also re- <br></br> ctify all unjust things between Man &amp; Man. </p>
      <p><a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Ockerhousen</a> came afterwards to keep Meetings at <br></br><a href="#mlpla000091.html">Hallifax</a>, which I attended with blessingfor my heart, beg <br></br> ged to be under the B<sup>rn</sup> Care and in their Society, w<sup>ch</sup><br></br> also was granted to my great Joy and was thankfull for it. <br></br> I continued also to go to Church but
         					seldom heard what my <br></br> Soul longed for; and often sighed: Thou o dear <a href=".html">Jesu</a>! Shalt be <br></br> my all, my Sacrifice and Priest. Thou art too strong for all <br></br> my bitterest Foes. None can thy Blood successfully
         						oppose."</p>
      <p> Upon her earnest request she was received into the Congregation<br></br> and got her right and Title amidst the Flock &amp; house of <a href=".html">God</a><br></br> and she <br></br> was admitted to the holy Sacrament</p>
      <p> her Spirit was lively, but her tabernacle subject to many In- <br></br> firmities. An Asthmatic
         						disorder hindered her these many <br></br> Years from going much abroad. But as long as she could <br></br> creep, she seldom missed any Meetings. To read the holy <br></br> Scripture was her private comfort, and she had got very <br></br> much aquainted with it, and thought much
         					abt under- <br></br> standing the same and feeling in her own heart what <br></br> she read. These latter 12 months past her Infirmity grew <br></br> stronger and her short breath <del>has</del> prevented her from go- <br></br> ing as far even as to the
         						Stanary. But during the Meeting<br></br> she usually had her private Devotion to the head so <br></br> full of bruises (and was very glad when any of her friends <br></br> would tell her
         					the Subject of the Discourse.) She loved<br></br> the Congr<sup>n</sup>with all her heart, (All the scandalous reports </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> defamatory Libels or reasoning ag<sup>st</sup> the B<sup>rn</sup> did not shake <br></br> her. She believed solidly the B<sup>rn</sup> Church to be our Sav<sup>rs</sup><br></br>peculiar people and rejoiced that she had the Grace<br></br> to be a member of the same. She often said to those <br></br> that reasoned ag<sup>st</sup> them or bro<sup>t</sup> all sorts of Tales to her:
         					<br></br> "The B<sup>rn</sup> will stand and all those that are against them will <br></br> be confounded and found Lyars, for the Lord is with them <br></br> She and
         					her husband had some years ago got Leave to <br></br> come and live among the B<sup>rn</sup> at <a href="#mlpla000048.html">Lambshill</a>, But her <br></br> husband from a Scrupulosity ab<sup>t</sup> his coming thro &amp;
         					<br></br> getting his Livelyhood, declined it. She was often <br></br>grieved abt it and said: "Tho she loved her husband very <br></br> much, yet that thing she could hardly forgive him.) <br></br> Their house was open for the Brn at all times, and she <br></br><del>their</del> thought it a great Blessing if they would put <br></br> up with the Entertainment and reception she could <br></br> give them. She
         					was these many months in great <br></br> pain all over, but could forget it easily when she <br></br> had an opporutnity of conversing with any one abt
         					<br></br> our d<sup>r</sup>Sav<sup>r</sup> and his Wounds. Many of her Neighbours <br></br> and acquaintances came sometimes to talk with her. <br></br> They had a peculiar confidence
         					to her and told her <br></br> freely their troubles (whether outward or inward) She <br></br> used to comfort them with the
         					meritorious troubles<br></br> and Sufferings of our blessedSav<sup>r</sup> for us (When <br></br> she met with any that had fallen out, or had an <br></br>Enmity ag<sup>st</sup> each other, She would tell <del>every</del><sup>each</sup> one <br></br> that it came from their bad heart, which <del>they</del><br></br> at such opportunites shewd itself, that they might <br></br> know it, and seek to our Sav<sup>r</sup> to be cured) She was <br></br> one of them that endeavoured to make Peace between <br></br> persons and her Counsel was often blessed &amp; <br></br> successful. (A few days before her Dissolution she <br></br>desired that some persons might be called to her, be- <br></br> cause she knew that they thro Reasoning had </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> brought themselves into Darkness and were suffering harm, <br></br> Those abt her said: It would be of no Effect, she would do no <br></br> good to them,
         					she should let it alone, because she was so weak <br></br> and would only make herself uneasy, She answ: Pray, <br></br> let me do it, one does not know,
         					what the last words of a dying <br></br> person may effect upon them. Her <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Alice Metcalf</a> was <br></br> these several months mostly ab<sup>t</sup> her in the day time, and can <br></br> not express, what a Blessing she has been to her in the troubles<br></br> of mind in which She was of late. </p>
      <p> One has those many years expected that she would not hold <br></br> long, but her peculiar Chearfullness, patience &amp; Sinnerlikeness <br></br> made
         					them all think, that our Savr would take her home <br></br> unto himself, and that she would not recover this time) <br></br> Last good fryday after
         					the publick Meeting, she <br></br> had her Share in the holy Sacramt brought unto her by <a href="#mlper000328.html">B<sup>r</sup><br></br> Pyrlaus</a>; she received it with great Bowedness &amp; Eagerness &amp;
         					<br></br> the Transaction was attended with an awfull and sensible <br></br> feeling of the nearness of our tormented husband. And <br></br> this proved to
         					be the last time. (When <a href="#mlper000328.html">B<sup>r</sup></a> &amp; <a href=".html">S<sup>r</sup> Pyrlaus</a> was <br></br> to visit her June 2<sup>d</sup> and spoke the Communicants, the latter <br></br> spoke also with our d<sup>r</sup>S<sup>r</sup>: &amp; asked her, whether she thought <br></br> she would continue<del>d</del> till she had got the Corpse &amp;

         					no matter, I shall keep it with him above, &amp; so <br></br> it proved, for she went home the same <del>night</del> &amp; day <br></br> before midnight.) </p>
      <p> Some months ago, when she thought that this her present Illness<br></br> would be her last, she expressed constantly her Concern about <br></br> her husband. O said she, nothing troubles
         					my mind, but when <br></br> I relfect upon my husband I am anxious. I know him <br></br> best, I am in pain for him. She often
         					with Tears begd <br></br> him to cleave close to our d<sup>r</sup>Sav<sup>r</sup> with his whole heart and <br></br> to take the B<sup>rns</sup> advise and never to leave them. <del>Br Pyr</del><br></br> (She was advised to resign him up to our Sav<sup>r</sup>, and to <br></br> not to make herself uneasy.

He <br></br> told us, that the close Connexion she had with our Sav<sup>r</sup><br></br> in the day time, continued also in the night, he often <br></br> was waked by hearing her sing in Sleep, she sometimes <br></br><del>would</del> spoke tenderly with our Sav<sup>r</sup> and often had re- <br></br> freshing Dreams of him. (Four days before her dissolut <br></br> ion she dreamed: That a man came to her Bedside <br></br> and took her Drinking Pot,
         					drunk all up, that <del>she</del><br></br><del>had</del> was put there for her refreshment. She thinking it <br></br> was her husband, reasoned within herself &amp; thought It is <br></br> however quite wrong in him, to <sup>sip of</sup><del>take</del> my Drink, all y<sup>e</sup><br></br> little refreshm<sup>t</sup> I can take, <del>and to</del> But at Looking at <br></br> him It struck into her mind That it was the Saviour. O <br></br> thought she: It is my dearest Sav<sup>r</sup> he is wellcome to it, <br></br> he shall have me and all what I have. She catchd hold <br></br> of him at the same time &amp; cried: Dont leave,
         					dont <br></br> Leave me, take me with Thee. He thereupon took her by <br></br> one arm, threw her over his Shoulders. She clasp her <br></br> arm round his neck &amp; Thought Well! new he
         					has me <br></br> I will hold him fast. And while he carried her away, <br></br> She lookd back on her Bed to see, whether her body <br></br> was gone too but she saw it behind, and thought
         					Its <br></br> no matter, I shall get it once ag<sup>n</sup>. When she awoke <br></br> they saw she was extraordinary chearfull &amp;
         						happy and <br></br> the meditation on this dream made her forget the Pain<br></br> and strengthned her wonderfully. and several other <br></br> pretty dreams she had, at times, that are to long to insert <br></br> here). </p>
      <p> All her neighbours, relations &amp; acquaintance came to see her <br></br> in her Sickness, and were suprized at her Chearfullness and <br></br>Confidence in our Sav<sup>r</sup> &amp; went away much affected, testi- <br></br> fying that she certainly was a happy woman. Her <br></br>
