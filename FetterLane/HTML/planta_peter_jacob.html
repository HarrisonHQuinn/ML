      <h2>Peter Jacob Planta</h2>
      <p>Memoir of the Life of our late venerable &amp; <br></br>happily departed <a href=".html">Br Peter Jacob Planta</a>, who <br></br>entered into the joy of his Lord, at <a href="#mlpla000063.html">Ockbrook</a>, <br></br><em>May the 6<sup>th</sup> 1815</em>, in the 94<sup>th</sup> year of <br></br> his age, written
         							by himself.</p>
      <p>I was born at <a href="#mlpla000085.html">Jonkioping a town in <br></br> Sweden</a>, <em>Dec<sup>r</sup> the 5<sup>th</sup>, old stile in the <br></br> year 1721</em>. My Father's name was <a href="#mlper000535.html">Jacob <br></br> Planta</a> &amp; my Mother's maiden name <br></br><a href=".html">Martha Ruda</a>. They were both of the <br></br>Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters, <br></br> the elder was born during my Mother's <br></br> marriage to her first husband, whose <br></br>
         						name was <a href=".html">Peter Hilling</a>. Our Parents <br></br> spared no pains in giving us a religious <br></br> &amp;
         						genteel education; we had morning <br></br> &amp; evening prayers in the family, to <br></br> which the servants were also admitted.</p>
      <p> My dear Mother would often read in <br></br> the bible, &amp; after prayers, used to re- <br></br> late to us pleasing scriptural his <br></br> tories,
         						especially such as had a reference <br></br> to the life, sufferings &amp; death of our <br></br> dear Lord
         						&amp; Saviour, &amp; also his conversations </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> with his disciples &amp; some of the persecut- <br></br> tions which the latter had to endure for <br></br> his sake. On such occasions I used to <br></br> sit on her lap, &amp;
         						sometimes asked what <br></br> reward the disciples had for their faithful- <br></br> ness to our Saviour: to which she replied: <br></br> "They
         						are richly rewarded for they are now <br></br>exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly <br></br> kingdom, singing his praises, &amp; adoring<br></br> him for ever! I said with tears, O my <br></br> dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at <br></br> the time our Saviour was upon earth, <br></br> I also would have served him &amp; suffered<br></br> for his sake. My Mother replied weeping, <br></br> my dear child, if you had lived at that <br></br> time you might perhaps have been of <br></br>
         						the number of those who cried out, cru- <br></br> cify him! crucify him! I said, O no, I never <br></br> would, but I should have loved him dearly. </p>
      <p> She then blessed me, &amp; prayed the Lord to <br></br> keep me as his property, &amp; to preserve <br></br> me
         						throughout my future life from sin, <br></br> &amp; the seductions of this evil world, until <br></br> I should be with him in his heavenly <br></br> kingdom, &amp; then added that all
         						those who <br></br>loved &amp; served him here, would share <br></br> in the same blessings which his disciples <br></br> did. - This made
         						a deep impression on my <br></br> mind, &amp; was the first time when I </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> but to have felt a real &amp; tender love &amp; <br></br>attachment in my heart to our dear Saviour, <br></br> &amp; in the sequel I always wished &amp; prayed that I <br></br> might become &amp; remain a true child of <br></br><a href=".html">God</a>. When I was about <em>4 years of age</em>, <br></br> I experienced a remarkable preservation <br></br>
         						of my life. Having ran out of the house <br></br> unobserved, with a spoon in my hand, I <br></br> came to <a href="#mlpla000177.html">Lake Wetter</a>, which
         						was not <br></br> far distant from our house, &amp; there <br></br> being a broad plank laid over the water, <br></br> I got to the end of it, &amp; was sitting on <br></br> it, playing
         						with the water, &amp; throwing <br></br> it up with the spoon, admiring the <br></br> drops which appeared to me like pearls. </p>
      <p> A woman who came to fetch water, called <br></br> out to me to take care that I did not fall <br></br> into the water, to whom I replied: I will <br></br> not fall in, but she had
         						scarcely returned <br></br> to her house before she thought that she <br></br> heard a plunge in the water, upon <br></br> which she set down her pail, &amp; ran <br></br> towards the
         						lake. Perceiving me in <br></br> the water, she ventured in, &amp; with difficulty <br></br> caught hold of me by the hair of my <br></br> head, &amp; drawing me out, she laid me <br></br>
         						across the plank, believing me to be <br></br> dead. She then carried me home to my <br></br> Parents, who, with the whole family were </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p>greatly alarmed, &amp; exceeding distressed, as they <br></br> could perceived no signs of life
         						in me. I <br></br> was however put into a warm bed, &amp; after <br></br> some time, while they were lamenting over <br></br> me, I came to myself &amp;
         						said dear Mamma <br></br> don't cry for me, I am here, &amp; to the great <br></br> joy of the whole family I recovered. As <br></br> I increased in years, I experienced several <br></br> preservations of my life, having been <br></br> in danger of losing it,
         						both by fire &amp; water <br></br> &amp; once escaped being murdered. My Parents <br></br> being desirous to give me a good education, <br></br> procured
         						a private Tutor in the house, <br></br> until I went to a large
         						school, in which <br></br> I continued till my Father's happy depar- <br></br> ture, which took place <em>in my 10<sup>th</sup> year</em>.</p>
      <p> My Mother's intention was that I should <br></br> continue my studies, wishing me to be <br></br> a Ministter of the Gospel, which also accord- <br></br>
         						ed with my inclination. However a <br></br> Relation persuaded my Mother to put <br></br> me apprentice to an eminent Surgeon<br></br> &amp; Apothecary in <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gothenburg</a>. Here I had <br></br> a favorable opportunity to learn Pharmacy <br></br> &amp; Chemistry, &amp; as my master had very <br></br> extensive
         						practice, &amp; employed me to <br></br> visit his patients, I gradually began <br></br> to practice myself. &amp; gave considerable <br></br>satisfaction to my employer.</p>
      <p> Having been awakened to a sense of </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> my lost condition, I was for several years <br></br>much concerned for my salvation, yea I may <br></br> say ever since I was a child, the Holy Ghost<br></br> carried on his work in my heart, by which <br></br> I was prevented from many sinful things, altho' <br></br> I did frequently fall into sin, repenting &amp; sinning <br></br> alternately, so that when I would do good, evil <br></br> was present with me. I felt frequently a <br></br>great desire to separate myself from the <br></br> world, &amp; used to walk in the fields, where I <br></br> could be alone, praying to our dear
         							Saviour, <br></br> in which I took great delight. At such <br></br> times I felt much pleasure in singing, <br></br>praises &amp; thanksgiving <a href=".html">God</a>; &amp; nothing <br></br> afforded me greater joy, than to thank our <br></br>Saviour for the many preservations I had <br></br> experienced from him, when in danger of <br></br> my life. However I also, alas! often forgot
         						<br></br> myself, &amp; gave way to levity when play- <br></br> ing with my companions. But the good <br></br> spirit of <a href=".html">God</a> frequently
         						reminded me <br></br> to seek the One thing needful. I felt a <br></br>strong desire to be a child of <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; <br></br> when I was invited with my Parents <br></br> to
         						entertainments, at which was music <br></br> &amp; dancing, I felt afterwards, great un- <br></br> easiness, &amp;, like one who is sick, not
         						<br></br> understanding properly the accusations <br></br> of my conscience. <em>When I was about 13 <br></br> years of age</em> I had a great desire to <br></br>enjoy the Holy Comn, for which purpose </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> I underwent an examination, &amp; was encouraged <br></br> to partake. The first time I had the favor to <br></br> approach the table of the
         								Lord, it was with <br></br>fear &amp; trembling, lest I should receive it <br></br> unworthily, but at the enjoyment of this
         							divine <br></br> repast, I felt exceedingly happy, yea more <br></br> so than I can express. In the sequel, whilst <br></br> the
         							Holy Ghost was operating upon my heart, <br></br> I frequently examined myself, fearing I was <br></br> not
         						yet a child of <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; yet earnestly <br></br> desiring to be one. Such was the state of
         						<br></br> my mind when I came to <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gothenburg</a>. I <br></br> experienced, at first much
         						attention from the <br></br> family in which I resided as an Apprentice, so <br></br> long as I conformed to every thing in it. How <br></br> ever the great concern I had for my salvation <br></br> &amp; the thought of not being a child of <a href=".html">God</a>, gave <br></br> me much uneasiness. I was always glad<br></br> whenever I could be alone, &amp; pour out the desire <br></br> of my heart before <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; frequently prayed <br></br> in stillness to him. I also resolved to with <br></br> draw from all worldly amusements &amp; to <br></br> spend the little time I had
         						to myself, in <br></br> spiritual exercises, longing to be assured that <br></br> I was a child of <a href=".html">God</a>. Sometimes I <br></br> arose in cold
         						frosty nights, prostrating <br></br> myself before <a href=".html">God</a>, &amp; praying most fer- <br></br> vently unto
         						him, but it afforded me <br></br> no relief. I thought then that my <br></br>sorrow for my sins was not yet great </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> enough &amp; often repeated the 10 Command- <br></br> ments, in order to see &amp; feel my deviations <br></br> &amp; sins, but as I could not cry &amp;
         							weep like <br></br><a href=".html">David</a>, who all the night made his bed to <br></br> swim, &amp; watered his couch with his tears,
         						<br></br> I thought my grief was not intense enough.</p>
      <p> But all my endeavours were in vain, because <br></br> I erred, in supposing that if I could but weep <br></br> much over my sins &amp; repent of them, then <br></br> the Lord would receive me as his child, &amp; com- <br></br>
         							fort me. I was convinced of the all sufficiency <br></br> of our Lord &amp; Saviour, suffering for sinners, <br></br> but thought I must be thus qualified before <br></br> I could receive this blessing. I
         						became now <br></br>very zealous, frequently reproving others for sin, <br></br> &amp; my singular conduct brought on me much <br></br> persecution &amp; hatred, which however I <br></br>gladly suffered, bearing all with patience <br></br> &amp; never resenting any ill treatment, but <br></br> on
         						the contrary did such persons all the <br></br> service I could, &amp; whenever opportunities <br></br> offered, spoke to them concerning our Saviour.</p>
      <p> Two persons in the family where I lodged <br></br> being awakened to a sense of their lost <br></br> condition, one of them caused me much<br></br>trouble &amp; uneasiness, on account of his <br></br>fears &amp; unbelief, thinking he could not be <br></br>forgiven. He fell at last into a <br></br>melancholy, frequently hiding himself, </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> &amp; even attempted to take away his life so that <br></br> he appeared in a state of mental derangement.</p>
      <p> I used my utmost endeavours to nurture him, <br></br>fearing that in case he should commit suicide <br></br> a great dishonor would be brought on the gospel. <br></br> One time he sent me a message <sup>with</sup><del>of</del> his last fare- <br></br> well, having locked himself up with a view to <br></br> self-destruction. This caused me unspeak- <br></br>
         							able distress, &amp; tho' I was at that time en- <br></br> gaged in very urgent business, &amp; in company <br></br> with several persons, yet I took the key of <br></br> the
         						cellar, ran down &amp; locked the door, &amp; <br></br> kneeling down by a hogshead of turpentine, I wept<br></br> &amp; prayed most fervently to our Saviour, (with <br></br>great confidence), that he would preserve the poor <br></br> man's life, &amp; it seemed to me as if I heard <br></br>
         							a voice saying - Be comforted, no evil shall <br></br> hurt him. This I believed, &amp; arose, giving <br></br>thanks to <a href=".html">God</a> my Saviour, &amp; returned cheerful <br></br> ly to my business, till about 12 o'clock at night, <br></br> being uneasy<del>ness</del> in my mind,
         						I removed some <br></br> boards &amp; other things, when I found him alive <br></br> &amp; feeling thankful to
         							<a href=".html">God</a> for his preservation, <br></br> I asked him why he had not performed <sup>executed</sup> his <br></br> intention,
         						to which he replied, that when he <br></br> was about to attempt it, he fell, &amp; all his <br></br> strength was taken from him, so that he <br></br> could
         							neither move a limb, nor speak <br></br> a word, till I came. I spoke comfortably<br></br> to him, encouraging him to take his <br></br> refuge to our Saviour &amp; conducting him <br></br> to his room, I prayed with him, &amp;
         						in the <br></br> sequel he grew better. The other person </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> who was awakened was the Cook,
         						who <br></br> died suddenly, but very happily. She had <br></br> been much beloved by her Mistress, &amp;
         						<br></br> her Mistress' Mother, &amp; her sudden death <br></br> caused the old Lady to swoon away. I was <br></br> then, (altho I had been much
         							despised &amp; <br></br> derided on account of religion,) called upon <br></br> to speak comfort to the old lady, &amp; as soon <br></br> as
         						she recovered, she took me by the hand <br></br> &amp; begged my pardon, adding: "I have been <br></br> the cause of the persecution you have suffered."</p>
      <p> I replied, 'I have no occasion to forgive you, <br></br> for you have done me more good than harm, since <br></br> it has caused me to cleave closer to
         						my Sa- <br></br> viour, who will hear the prayers of all repent- <br></br> ing sinners. Thus her hatred &amp; persecution were <br></br> turned into great love &amp; kindness. About <br></br> this time I attended the
         						preaching of the <br></br><a href=".html">Rev<sup>d</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Lindberg</a> in <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gothenburg</a>. He observed <br></br> in his sermon, that
         						there were several kinds <br></br> of people, who were hindered from enjoying<br></br> the happiness which the Lord would willingly <br></br> bestow upon them, if they would but come in
         						<br></br> the way &amp; order of his appointment. Among <br></br> one of these sorts of well meaning souls, I <br></br> found myself so completely described as if I <br></br> had opened my
         						whole mind to him. He <br></br> remarked that some people thought that if <br></br> they could arrive at a certain degree of ex- <br></br> cessive
         							grief &amp; anguish, &amp; could shed repenting <br></br> tears night &amp; day, that then the
         							Lord</p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> would have mercy upon them, forgive them <br></br> all their sins, &amp; be gracious
         						unto them. But, <br></br> said he, this is worth nothing, for nothing is <br></br> meritorious on our part. Nothing but alone <br></br> the meritorious holy life, bitter sufferings, bleeding <br></br> &amp; dying of our Lord &amp; Saviour<a href=".html">Jesus Christ</a>, <br></br> his being wounded for our transgressions, &amp; his <br></br>sorrows &amp; anguish until death, this alone <br></br> meritorious, &amp; whoever can believe this, <br></br> will
         						obtain mercy &amp; forgiveness of all his sins.</p>
      <p> He added - My dear Friend, whoever thou art <br></br> &amp; wherever thou art standing or seated in this <br></br> place - Come with me, &amp; let us mount up <br></br> by faith to
         							<a href=".html">Mount Calvary</a>, &amp; behold the <br></br> Cross of Christ, the sufferingLamb of <a href=".html">God</a>, <br></br> view his wounds, his thorny crown, &amp; all his <br></br>torments by faith. It was then, that with <br></br> a happyastonishment I truly beheld, as <br></br> for me, my Saviour bowing his head, <br></br> &amp; giving up
         							his spirit into the hands of <br></br> his dear heavenly Father, &amp; in that mo- <br></br> ment all my uneasiness &amp; heaviness, <br></br> which had tormented my conscience <br></br> forsook me, &amp; I was filled with such <br></br>joy &amp; happiness, as not to be able to <br></br> describe it, &amp; I heard no more what <br></br> the Preacher said,
         						but rejoiced in stillness, <br></br>thanking my dear Saviour, being fully <br></br> assured that he had forgiven
         						me all </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> my sins. I returned home filled with <br></br>Gratitude &amp; entering my chamber, I <br></br> locked the door, fell prostrate before him, <br></br> &amp; offered him the sacrifice of thanksgiving.</p>
      <p> I felt as new born, but this lasted only a <br></br> day &amp; a half, when a person treated me ill, <br></br> Which caused anger to arise <sup>with</sup>in my breast, <br></br> altho’ I did not reply one word, yet it caused <br></br> me to lose this impression of happiness, &amp; <br></br> plunged me into distress, so that I could <br></br> not rest, fearing I had lost the grace<br></br> bestowed upon me, &amp; should be lost. I called <br></br> upon a Minister, to whom I opened my mind, <br></br> &amp; informed him of my situation &amp; grief. He <br></br>comforted me with these words: “My dear friend, <br></br> the <a href=".html">Apostle Peter</a> once asked the <a href=".html">Lord Jesus</a>, <br></br> how often he should forgive his brother? Till
         						<br></br> seven times?” To which our Lord replied: <br></br> I say not unto thee until 7 times, but <br></br> until 70 times 7. Now if our good
         							Lord, <br></br> commanded a sinful man to forgive his <br></br> brother so often, what must not he himself
         						<br></br> do, when a poor sinner repents, &amp; prays <br></br> to him for forgiveness, since he is the foun- <br></br>
         						tain of all goodness, grace &amp; mercy!” I asked <br></br> him if I might pray to our Saviour to <br></br>forgive me? to which he replied: <br></br> certainly, for as often as we fall we <br></br> must rise &amp; go to our merciful<br></br>Saviour, who will in no wise cast out <br></br> those who come to him. I asked <del>if I</del></p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> &amp; may I go to him whenever I want com- <br></br> fort? to which he answered, By all <br></br> means. This proved a great comfort to <br></br> me &amp; it caused me to feel quite happy, <br></br> because our Lord would
         						be so gracious<br></br> I followed his advice &amp; found comfort. Feeling <br></br> myself one time exceeding unworthy, so that <br></br> I durst not venture to go to
         						the Holy Com<sup>n</sup><br></br> I called upon a pious Clergyman to whom <br></br> I opened my whole mind. He comforted me <br></br> by saying: My dear Friend, even
         						such as you <br></br> are, the Lord<a href=".html">Jesus</a> calls to come, for he <br></br> says: "Come until me all ye that labor &amp; <br></br> are heavy laden &amp; I will give you rest;
         						<br></br> take my yoke upon you &amp; learn of me <br></br> for I am meek &amp; lowly in heart, &amp; ye <br></br>
         						shall find rest unto your souls. He <br></br> admonished me not to absent myself, <br></br> adding that he intended the following Sunday <br></br> to partake of
         							the H. Com<sup>n</sup>  himself &amp; <br></br> that if I would attend, the Lord would <br></br> certainly bless &amp; comfort me. Hereupon <br></br> I ventured with trembling, &amp; during
         							the <br></br> participation experienced inexpressible joy<br></br> &amp; comfort. During the time when I ex- <br></br> perienced <sup>endured</sup> much persecution, I felt a <br></br>great desire to become acquainted with <br></br> a genuine child of <a href=".html">God</a>, if there were <br></br> any
         						in this world, &amp; often prayed that <br></br> the Lord would bring it about. And <br></br> was once walking in a private place </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> and weeping, I perceived a hill on the top of <br></br> which was a cavity, which when I perceived, I <br></br>rejoiced, thinking this a suitable place, in which <br></br> I could pour out my whole soul before the Lord,
         						<br></br> unobserved as I thought by any one. I em- <br></br> braced this opportunity with gratitude, &amp; <br></br> kneeling down, prayed with fervor to our Saviour, <br></br> mentioning to him all my concerns, intreating
         						<br></br> him with great earnestness, if there was any <br></br> genuine child of <a href=".html">God</a> in the
         						world, he would <br></br> bring him to me, or me to him, in order <br></br> that we might become acquainted, during <br></br> which prayer I felt richly
         							comforted with <br></br> his divine presence. Whilst I was at prayer, <br></br> it happened that 2 persons belonging to the <br></br>B<sup>rn's</sup> Cong<sup>n</sup> came that way, &amp; when they <br></br> arrived near the summit of the hill, they <br></br> heard the sound of a voice, &amp; the one observed <br></br> to the other, that
         						there was a poor sinner <br></br> praying to our Saviour. Let us (said they,) <br></br> not disturb him. One of them however, <br></br> came softly
         						&amp; unperceived by me, to the <br></br> summit, &amp; knew me, as I was in a public <br></br> line of business. I did not, at that time, <br></br> know that there was such a people as
         						the <br></br>United Brn, nor even that there were any <br></br> awakened in <a href="#mlpla000086.html">Gottenburg</a> who were so near to <br></br> me. The above 2 B<sup>rn</sup> persons acquainted the <br></br>B<sup>rn</sup> on their return, what they had observed.</p>
      <p> Some days after, a certain B<sup>n</sup>, who was a <br></br> gentleman's gardener, &amp; who was in the habit <br></br> of coming to our house, &amp; supplying us with </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> medicinal herbs, began to notice me in a <br></br> manner he had never done before, &amp; at last <br></br> invited me to pay him a visit. I thanked<br></br> him, but excused myself with observing that <br></br> I had no time to spare, &amp; if I had any I <br></br> knew how to make a better use of it; for <br></br> I found to be
         						enticed to enter into worldly <br></br> amusements. However he came in the sequel <br></br> to visit me occasionally, &amp; one Sunday called <br></br> a little before service time, on
         						purpose <br></br> that he might be with me alone. When <br></br> all were gone to <a href=".html">Church</a>, he said to me, <br></br> My Friend, I believe you to be a
         						person <br></br> who loves our Saviour, &amp; I am another, <br></br> would it not be well if we were better <br></br>

         						(having <br></br> requested leave,) I set off, &amp; walking there a <br></br> large ground, on a broad foot path, I per- <br></br> ceived a Gentleman's carriage, stopping </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> in the high road, &amp; the Gentleman &amp; <br></br> his servant
         						getting out. They got over the <br></br> fence &amp; ran towards me. Altho, I might <br></br> have easily ran away I stopped, thinking that <br></br> I was not on the <sup>right</sup> road, altho' it appeared to me <br></br> like a public path. When the Gentleman <br></br> came up to me, he immediately pulled off <br></br> my cloak, &amp; gave it in
         							anger to his servant, <br></br> adding who gave you leave to walk here? <br></br> I replied humbly that I had not known I <br></br> was trespassing,
         						&amp; begged pardon, while at <br></br> the same time I unbuttoned my coat, with <br></br> a view to give him that also, calling to <br></br> mind our Saviour's words: Him that <br></br> taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take <br></br> thy coat also; upon which his anger sub- <br></br>
         						sided. I then asked permission to return, <br></br> but he said, As you have come so far you <br></br> may proceed. He refused however to take <br></br> my coat, but kept my cloak, upon
         						which <br></br> we parted. When I arrived at the garden <br></br> &amp; had shown my ticket, I was admitted <br></br> &amp; going up to the house, I knocked at the <br></br> door but when
         						it was opened, I saw many <br></br> persons in the house; &amp; thinking they <br></br> were worldly-minded people I shut the <br></br> door in haste, &amp; returned into the garden <br></br>weeping. My friend followed me, &amp; <br></br> asked the cause of my weeping? I re- <br></br> plied that I was exceedingly sorry that <br></br> I was deceived, for if he were a child of <br></br><a href=".html">God</a>, he would not have such a number </p>PAGE BREAK
      <p> of people with him: He answered: But <br></br> what will you say, when I inform you <br></br> that all these persons are children of <br></br><a href=".html">God</a>, Come &amp; see. I said, that I could <br></br> not have believed there were so many <br></br> children of <a href=".html">God</a> in the whole world.</p>
      <p> Having entered the house &amp; standing at <br></br> the door, I asked with surprise, if all <br></br> present were children of <a href=".html">God</a>, which <br></br> was answered in a friendly manner in <br></br> the affirmative. I said with tears of joy, <br></br>
         						then I am not worthy to be among you. <br></br> However they asked me to sit down &amp; they <br></br> would communicate some written accounts <br></br> from the B<sup>rns</sup>  Cong<sup>n</sup>. I said, is there <br></br> indeed a Cong<sup>n</sup> of B<sup>rn </sup> existing in our <br></br> times, like the Cong<sup>ns</sup> in the times of the <br></br> Apostles? They replied: yes I said: <br></br> Then I wish to live in such an one, <br></br> to which they answered, if it was the <br></br> will of
         						our Saviour that I should, he would <br></br> bring it to pass. In this manner I got <br></br> acquainted with the B<sup>rn</sup> &amp; after this <br></br> interview longed to attain my wish, <br></br> but could not accomplish it for several

      <p>His late Wife departed into a happy eter- <br></br> nity in <a href="#mlpla000063.html">Ockbrook</a> on <em>Decr the 17<sup>th</sup> 1793</em>. His <br></br> daughter <a href=".html">Benigna</a> came from <a href="#mlpla000003.html">Fulneck</a>, to <br></br> keep his home, &amp; care for her aged Parent, <br></br>
         						&amp; which she did with much faithfulness: <br></br> when however, her state of health was <br></br> such that she could no longer attend upon <br></br> her dear Father as formerly,
         						&amp; she in- <br></br> formed him of it, He folded his hands &amp; <br></br> explained Then my dear Lord take me <br></br>
         							first. It was on <em>Thursday May the <br></br> 4<sup>th</sup></em> when he was as well as usual, that <br></br> his daughter, feeling her extreme weakness, <br></br> had for the first time made him fully <br></br> sensible that her ability
         						&amp; not her love<br></br> failed; he then uttered that fervent<br></br> request to be first taken, &amp; he was that <br></br> very evening struck for death whilst <br></br> his daughter was absent at the Sister's <br></br>
         							Festival to which she had been <br></br> carried in a chair, &amp; which was the <br></br> last meeting she attended; <em>her Father

         						<br></br> flows from a sense of his pardoning love.</p>
      <p> Several years back, his recollection began <br></br> gradually to fail him, &amp; his mental powers <br></br> grew weaker, but his soul continued alive in <br></br> those great &amp;
         						momentous subjects upon which <br></br> he rested all his hopes for present &amp; <br></br> eternal salvation. He was for some <br></br> time, obliged to
         						take to his bed, being <br></br> exceedingly debilitated, &amp; was accustomed to <br></br> say, I am well, only very weak, I shall go <br></br> to my dear Saviour, in his own good time.</p>
      <p> He was sensible to the last, &amp; when visited <br></br> by <a href=".html">B<sup>r</sup> Franklin</a> a little before his departure, <br></br> he stretched forth his arms in a most af- <br></br> fectionate manner
         						towards him &amp; said: <br></br> "Pray with me." He was then observed to <br></br> be engaged with his Redeemer, in whom <br></br> he had an unshaken confidence, &amp; was <br></br> heard to say in broken accents, Ye are <br></br> come unto <a href="#mlpla000368.html">Mount Zion</a>. Peace &amp; <br></br>serenity appeared in his countenance, <br></br> &amp; nothing seemed to disturb his last <br></br> moments, his happy
         						soul took flight <br></br> into the presence of <a href=".html">Jesus</a>, on the morning <br></br> of <em>May 6</em> in

      <p> closed his pilgrimage here below, in a <br></br> full age, like as a shock of corn cometh <br></br> in his season, in the 94<sup>th</sup> year of his <br></br> age,

      <p> It was something remarkable that his <br></br> daughter <a href=".html">Benigna</a>, who had cared for, <br></br> &amp; lived with her aged Father, for
         						upwards <br></br> of 20 years, ever since the departure of <br></br> her late mother, but who had been in <br></br> a declining state of health for several <br></br> years, departed this

         						age, 4 days after her Father, &amp; their <br></br> remains were interred on the <em>13<sup>th</sup></em>, when <br></br> this
         						important visitation was improved by <br></br> addressing a numerous &amp; respectable assembly, <br></br> who attended on the occasion in the words <br></br> of S<sup>t</sup> Paul to Timothy 2<sup>d</sup> Epistle Chap. 1.12. <br></br> I know in whom I have believed, &amp; am <br></br> persuaded that He, is able to keep that
