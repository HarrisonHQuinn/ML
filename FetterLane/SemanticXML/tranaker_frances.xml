            <div><pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MCH/MemLon_300046-01.jpg" n="1"></pb><p>Frances Sophia Tranaker was born at Westhofenin Alsatia Septr 25th 1727. Her Father CouncellorEngelbach, who together with his wife loved our Savr&amp; his people, were much concerned for the true happiness&amp; preservation of their Children, for which reason theydesired &amp; also obtained a marrd Br &amp; Sr from the Congnto live with them, in order to take care of their children.The awakening of our departed Sr was occasioned by herFather, who once late at night kneeled down before a Chairin the room where she lay, thinking she was asleep,&amp; prayed heartily to our Savr for himself &amp; his family,&amp; concluded his prayer with singing some Verses.This affected her very deeply, &amp; she wept &amp; prayedour Savr to have mercy on her &amp; to receive her as hisChild. In 1740 she was sent by her parents, according to her own desire, to the Girls Oeconomy inMarienborn, where she arrived July 26th &amp; in Octrfollowing she was received into the Congn, which sheoften called to mind as a very particular blessing toher, &amp; the 13th May 1741 she was admitted to the holycommunion. After that time she became more &amp; more sensible of her deep depravity, which cost hermuch distress &amp; many tears: but our dear Savr ma==nifested himself to her in his bleeding form on theCross as the Atoner for her Sins, she was richlycomforted, &amp; became very chearful  cheerful. Sometime aftershe was made use of as an assistant in the labouramong the great girls in Herrnhaag &amp; was afterdssent to Holland to serve in the Girls Oeconomy inHerrndyke &amp; 1750 she was called to go to England&amp; was used in the Girls Oeconomy then in Mile endnear London, from whence she was taken into thefamily of the late ordinary in Lindsey house, whereshe remained 2 years, &amp; had (as she has often men--tioned) such a blessed time for her heart, as remainedunforgotten by her. In 1755 she was sent to Fulneck to</p></div><div n="2" type="page"><pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MCH/MemLon_300046-02.jpg" n="2"></pb><p>o be Co=helper of the S: Srs &amp; choir=helper of thegreat girls: &amp; tho' she had here many trials ofvarious kinds to go thro': yet she remained chear=ful  cheerful &amp; contented, &amp; Shewed  Showed much faithfulness inher office, &amp; enjoyed the love &amp; confidence of allher Srs &amp; g: girls.      Octr 29th 1759 she wasmarried to Br George Franckere, &amp; on the 13th Novrfollowing she was blessed by Br Johannes as aDeaconess of the Church of the Brethren, &amp; thenshe went with to her husband to Bedford, where theyhad the care of that Congn, as they afterwardsalso had of these in Bristol &amp; London: &amp; in 1776they went in the same capacity to Fulneck wherethey arrived March 24th, &amp; had also the care ofthe 2 Childrens Oeconomies committed to them. Onemust give her the testimony, that, notwithstandingall her faults &amp; imperfections, she was very faithfulin all she was intrusted with, having the concernsof her Sisters &amp; the Children in the Oeconomy, towhom she was a truly tender mother, very muchat heart &amp; sparing no pains whatever in fulfillingall that she thought to be for their good. Hermarried state was blessed with 2 Sons &amp; 3 Daugh==ters, of whom one son &amp; 2 Daughters are gone torest before her, &amp; one Son &amp; one Daughter are in theCongn. At the end of last Septr she got a violentfever, which held her for several weeks, &amp; thenturned to a Dropey, under which she labouredwith encreasing  increasing pains for several months; butfrom the begining  beginning of her disorder it was clear in hermind, that she shod go to our dear Savr &amp; spokeoften of it with mel[?]dness of heart &amp; tears oflonging for that happy time; tho' it seemed some==times as if she would recover. She express'd veryoften in an affecting manner her Sinnerlike love &amp; </p></div><div n="3" type="page"><pb facs="http://moravianlives.bucknell.edu/MCH/MemLon_300046-03.jpg" n="3"></pb><p>&amp; hearty confidence to our dear Savr &amp; when hergreat pains, now &amp; then made her a little impatient [?????????], she was very sorry for it afterwards,&amp; said once among other things "O how insignificant"are my pains in compairson to what my dear"Saviour has suffered for my Sins"! The longershe lay, the more helpless she grew; but the love ofthe Srs &amp; their hearty willingness to serve her uponall occasions by night &amp; day was a great comfortto her &amp; all about her. On the 27th of March inthe Evening she desired her husband to bless herfor her departure, which (says he) I did witha feeling in my heart, which I am not able todescribe, delivering her up in a short prayer toher eternal husband &amp; pronouncing the Church'sblessing upon her in the presence of several Srs,who shed many tears on the occasion. OnMonday the 29th about noon, we saw that herdissolution drew near. She said, in brokenwords to me: "My faults are endless" &amp; uponasking her: Do you feel our Savrs gracious nearnessin your heart she answered, "I do." Then Isaid: When you come to our Saviour, will youkiss his thro'bred feel for us? She bowed herhead &amp; smiled: &amp; then her breath stop'd, &amp; herdear bought soul entered into her Lords joy inthe 57th year of her age.</p></div>
