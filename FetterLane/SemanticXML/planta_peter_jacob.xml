							<hi rend="underline">Memoir of the Life of our late venerable &amp; <lb/>
							happily departed <persName cert="high" type="real">Br Peter Jacob Planta</persName>, who <lb/>
							entered into joy of his Lord, at <placeName ref="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ockbrook" key="Ockbrook" cert="high">Ockbrook</placeName>, <lb/> 
							<date when="1815-05-06" cert="high">May the 6<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> 1815</date>, in the 94<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> year of <lb/>

						<persName cert="high" type="real">Martha Ruda</persName>. They were both of the <lb/>
						Lutheran Religion. I had two sisters, <lb/>
						the elder was born during my Mother's <lb/>
						marriage to her first husband, whose <lb/>
						name was <persName cert="high" type="real">Peter Hilling</persName>. Our Parents <lb/>
						spared no pains in giving us a religious <lb/>
						&amp; genteel education; we had morning <lb/>
						&amp; evening prayers in the family, to <lb/>
							which the servants were also admitted.</p>
					<p>
						My dear Mother would often read in <lb/>
						the bible, &amp; after prayers, used to re- <lb/>
						late to us pleasing scriptural his <lb/>
						tories, especially such as had a reference <lb/>
						to the life, sufferings &amp; death of our <lb/>
							dear Lord &amp; Saviour, &amp; also his conversations

						with his disciples &amp; some of the persecut-  <lb/>
						tions which the latter had to endure for <lb/>
						his sake. On such occasions I used to <lb/>
						sit on her lap, &amp; sometimes asked what <lb/>
						reward the disciples had for their faithful- <lb/>
						ness to our Saviour: to which she replied: <lb/>
						"They are richly rewarded for they are now <lb/>
						exceeding happy with Him in his heavenly <lb/>
						kingdom, singing his praises, &amp; adoring <lb/>
						him for ever! I said with tears, O my <lb/>
						dear Mamma, I wish that I had lived at <lb/>
						the time our Saviour was upon earth, <lb/>
						I also would have served him &amp; suffered <lb/>
						for his sake. My Mother replied weeping, <lb/>
						my dear child, if you had lived at that <lb/>
						time you might perhaps have been of <lb/>
						the number of those who cried out, cru- <lb/>
						cify him! crucify him! I said, O no, I never <lb/>
						would, but I should have loved him dearly. </p>
					<p>
						She then blessed me, &amp; prayed the Lord to <lb/>
						keep me as his property, &amp; to preserve <lb/>
						me throughout my future life from sin, <lb/>
						&amp; the seductions of this evil world, until <lb/>
						I should be with him in his heavenly <lb/>
						kingdom, &amp; then added that all those who <lb/>
						loved &amp; served him here, would share <lb/>
						in the same blessings which his disciples <lb/>
						did. - This made a deep impression on my <lb/>

						but to have felt a real &amp; tender love &amp; <lb/>
						attachment in my heart to our dear Saviour, <lb/>
						&amp; in the sequel I always wished &amp; prayed that I <lb/>
						might become &amp; remain a true child of <lb/>
						God. When I was about 4 years of age, <lb/>
						I experienced a remarkable preservation <lb/>
						of my life. Having ran out of the house <lb/>
						unobserved, with a spoon in my hand, I <lb/>
						came to Lake Wetter, which was not <lb/>
						far distant from our house, &amp; there <lb/>
						being a broad plank laid over the water, <lb/>
						I got to the end of it, &amp; was sitting on <lb/>
						it, playing with the water, &amp; throwing <lb/>
						it up with the spoon, admiring the  <lb/>
						drops which appeared to me like pearls. </p>
					<p>
						A woman who came to fetch water, called <lb/>
						out to me to take care that I did not fall <lb/>
						into the water, to whom I replied: I will <lb/>
						not fall in, but she had scarcely returned <lb/>
						to her house before she thought that she <lb/>

						don't cry for me, I am here, &amp; to the great <lb/>
						joy of the whole family I recovered. As <lb/>
						I increased in years, I experienced several <lb/>
						preservations of my life, having been <lb/>
						in danger of losing it, both by fire &amp; water <lb/>
						&amp; once escaped being murdered. My Parents <lb/>

						my lost condition, I was for several years <lb/>
						much concerned for my salvation, yea I may <lb/>
						say ever since I was a child, the Holy Ghost <lb/>
						carried on his work in my heart, by which  <lb/>
						I was prevented from many sinful things, altho' <lb/>
						I did frequently fall into sin, repenting &amp; sinning <lb/>
						alternately, so that when I would do good, evil <lb/>
						was present with me. I felt frequently a <lb/>
						great desire to separate myself from the <lb/>
						world, &amp; used to walk in the fields, where I <lb/>
						could be alone, praying to our dear Saviour, <lb/>
						in which I took great delight. At such <lb/>
						times I felt much pleasure in singing, <lb/>
						praises &amp; thanksgiving God; &amp; nothing <lb/>
						afforded me greater joy, than to thank our <lb/>
						Saviour for the many preservations I had <lb/>
						experienced from him, when in danger of <lb/>
						my life. However I also, alas! often forgot <lb/>
						myself, &amp; gave way to levity when play- <lb/>
						ing with my companions. But the good <lb/>
						spirit of God frequently reminded me  <lb/>
						to seek the One thing needful. I felt a <lb/>
						strong desire to be a child of God, &amp; <lb/>
						when I was invited with my Parents <lb/>
						to entertainments, at which was music <lb/>
						&amp; dancing, I felt afterwards, great un- <lb/>
						easiness, &amp;, like one who is sick, not <lb/>
						understanding properly the accusations <lb/>
						of my conscience. When I was about 13 <lb/>
						years of age I had a great desire to  <lb/>

						I underwent an examination, &amp; was encouraged <lb/>
						to partake. The first time I had the favor to <lb/>
						approach the table of the Lord, it was with <lb/>
						fear &amp; trembling, lest I should receive it <lb/>
						unworthily, but at the enjoyment of this divine <lb/>
						repast, I felt exceedingly happy, yea more <lb/>
						so than I can express. In the sequel, whilst <lb/>
						the Holy Ghost was operating upon my heart, <lb/>
						I frequently examined myself, fearing I was <lb/>
						not yet a child of God, &amp; yet earnestly <lb/>
						desiring to be one. Such was the state of <lb/>
						my mind when I came to Gothenburg. I <lb/>
						experienced, at first much attention from the <lb/>
						family in which I resided as an Apprentice, so <lb/>
						long as I conformed to every thing in it. How <lb/>
						ever the great concern I had for my salvation <lb/>
						&amp; the thought of not being a child of God, gave <lb/>
						me much uneasiness. I was always glad <lb/>
						whenever I could be alone, &amp; pour out the desire <lb/>
						of my heart before God, &amp; frequently prayed <lb/>
						in stillness to him. I also resolved to with <lb/>
						draw from all worldly amusements &amp; to <lb/>
						spend the little time I had to myself, in <lb/>
						spiritual exercises, longing to be assured that <lb/>
						I was a child of God. Sometimes I <lb/>
						arose in cold frosty nights, prostrating <lb/>
						myself before God, &amp; praying most fer- <lb/>
						vently unto him, but it afforded me <lb/>
						no relief. I thought then that my <lb/>

						enough &amp; often repeated the 10 Command- <lb/>

						&amp; sins, but as I could not cry &amp; weep like <lb/>
						David, who all the night made his bed to <lb/>
						swim, &amp; watered his couch with his tears, <lb/>
							I thought my grief was not intense enough.</p>
					<p>
						But all my endeavours were in vain, because <lb/>
						I erred, in supposing that if I could but weep <lb/>
						much over my sins &amp; repent of them, then <lb/>
						the Lord would receive me as his child, &amp; com- <lb/>
						fort me. I was convinced of the all sufficiency <lb/>
						of our Lord &amp; Saviour, suffering for sinners, <lb/>
						but thought I must be thus qualified before <lb/>
						I could receive this blessing. I became now <lb/>
						very zealous, frequently reproving others for sin, <lb/>
						&amp; my singular conduct brought on me much <lb/>
						persecution &amp; hatred, which however I <lb/>
						gladly suffered, bearing all with patience <lb/>
						&amp; never resenting any ill treatment, but <lb/>
						on the contrary did such persons all the <lb/>
						service I could, &amp; whenever opportunities <lb/>
							offered, spoke to them concerning our Saviour.</p>
					<p>
						Two persons in the family where I lodged <lb/>
						being awakened to a sense of their lost <lb/>
						condition, one of them caused me much <lb/>
						trouble &amp; uneasiness, on account of his <lb/>

					<p>
						I used my utmost endeavours to nurture him, <lb/>
						fearing that in case he should commit suicide <lb/>
						a great dishonor would be brought on the gospel. <lb/>							
						One time he sent me a message <add place="above">with</add> <del>of</del> his last fare- <lb/>
						well, having locked himself up with a view to <lb/>
						self-destruction. This caused me unspea- <lb/>
						able distress, &amp; tho' I was at that time en- <lb/>
						gaged in very urgent business, &amp; in company <lb/>
						with several persons, yet I took the key of <lb/>
						the cellar, ran down &amp; locked the door, &amp; <lb/>
						kneeling down by a hogshead of turpentine, I wept <lb/>
						&amp; prayed most fervently to our Saviour, (with <lb/>
						great confidence), that he would preserve the poor <lb/>
						man's life, &amp; it seemed to me as if I heard <lb/>
						a voice saying - Be comforted, no evil shall <lb/>
						hurt him. This I believed, &amp; arose, giving <lb/>
						thanks to God my Saviour, &amp; returned cheerful <lb/>
						ly to my business, till about 12 o'clock at night, <lb/>

						boards &amp; other things, when I found him alive <lb/>
						&amp; feeling thankful to God for his preservation, <lb/>
							I asked him why he had not performed <add place="above">executed</add> his <lb/>
						intention, to which he replied, that when he <lb/>
						was about to attempt it, he fell, &amp; all his <lb/>
						strength was taken from him, so that he <lb/>
						could neither move a limb, nor speak <lb/>
						a word, till I came. I spoke comfortably <lb/>
						to him, encouraging him to take his <lb/>

						who was awakened was the Cook, who <lb/>
						died suddenly, but very happily. She had <lb/>
						been much beloved by her Mistress, &amp; <lb/>
						her Mistress' Mother, &amp; her sudden death <lb/>
						caused the old Lady to swoon away. I was <lb/>
						then, (altho I had been much despised &amp; <lb/>
						derided on account of religion,) called upon <lb/>
						to speak comfort to the old lady, &amp; as soon <lb/>
						as she recovered, she took me by the hand <lb/>
						&amp; begged my pardon, adding: "I have been <lb/> 
							the cause of the persecution you have suffered."</p>
					<p>
						I replied, 'I have no occasion to forgive you, <lb/>
						for you have done me more good than harm, since <lb/>
						it has caused me to cleave closer to my Sa- <lb/>
						viour, who will hear the prayers of all repent- <lb/>
						ing sinners. Thus her hatred &amp; persecution were <lb/>
						turned into great love &amp; kindness. About <lb/>
						this time I attended the preaching of the <lb/>
						<persName cert="high" type="real">Rev<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> Lindberg</persName> in Gothenburg. He observed <lb/>
						in his sermon, that there were several kinds <lb/>
						of people, who were hindered from enjoying <lb/>
						the happiness which the Lord would willingly <lb/>
						bestow upon them, if they would but come in <lb/>
						the way &amp; order of his appointment. Among <lb/>
						one of these sorts of well meaning souls, I <lb/>
						found myself so completely described as if I <lb/>
						had opened my whole mind to him. He <lb/>
						remarked that some people thought that if <lb/> 
						they could arrive at a certain degree of ex- <lb/>

						would have mercy upon them, forgive them <lb/>
						all their sins, &amp; be gracious unto them. But, <lb/>
						said he, this is worth nothing, for nothing is  <lb/>
						meritorious on our part. Nothing but alone <lb/>
						the meritorious holy life, bitter sufferings, bleeding <lb/>
						&amp; dying of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ, <lb/>
						his being wounded for our transgressions, &amp; his <lb/>
						sorrows &amp; anguish until death, this alone <lb/>
						meritorious, &amp; whoever can believe this, <lb/>
							will obtain mercy &amp; forgiveness of all his sins.</p>
					<p>
						He added - My dear Friend, whoever thou art <lb/>
						&amp; wherever thou art standing or seated in this <lb/>
						place - Come with me, &amp; let us mount up <lb/>
						by faith to Mount Calvary, &amp; behold the <lb/>
						Cross of Christ, the suffering Lamb of God, <lb/>
						view his wounds, his thorny crown, &amp; all his <lb/>
						torments by faith. It was then, that with <lb/>
						a happy astonishment I truly beheld, as <lb/>
						for me, my Saviour bowing his head, <lb/>
						&amp; giving up his spirit into the hands of <lb/>
						his dear heavenly Father, &amp; in that mo- <lb/>
						ment all my uneasiness &amp; heaviness, <lb/>
						which had tormented my conscience <lb/>
						forsook me, &amp; I was filled with such <lb/>

					<p>
						I felt as new born, but this lasted only a <lb/>
						day &amp; a half, when a person treated me ill, <lb/>
						Which caused anger to arise <add place="above">with</add>in my breast, <lb/>
						altho’ I did not reply one word, yet it caused  <lb/>
						me to lose this impression of happiness, &amp; <lb/>
						plunged me into distress, so that I could <lb/>
						not rest, fearing I had lost the grace <lb/>
						bestowed upon me, &amp; should be lost. I called <lb/>
						upon a Minister, to whom I opened my mind, <lb/>
						&amp; informed him of my situation &amp; grief. He <lb/>
						comforted me with these words: “My dear friend, <lb/>
						the Apostle Peter once asked the Lord Jesus, <lb/>
						how often he should forgive his brother? Till <lb/>
						seven times?” To which our Lord replied: <lb/>
						I say not unto thee until 7 times, but <lb/>
						until 70 times 7. Now if our good Lord,  <lb/>
						commanded a sinful man to forgive his  <lb/>
						brother so often, what must not he himself <lb/> 
						do, when a poor sinner repents, &amp; prays  <lb/>
						to him for forgiveness, since he is the foun- <lb/>
						tain of all goodness, grace &amp; mercy!” I asked <lb/> 
						him if I might pray to our Saviour to <lb/>
						forgive me? to which he replied: <lb/>
						certainly, for as often as we fall we <lb/> 
						must rise &amp; go to our merciful <lb/>
						Saviour, who will in no wise cast out <lb/>

						&amp; may I go to him whenever I want com- <lb/>
						fort? to which he answered, By all <lb/>
						means. This proved a great comfort to <lb/>
						me &amp; it caused me to feel quite happy, <lb/>
						because our Lord would be so gracious <lb/>
						I followed his advice &amp; found comfort. Feeling <lb/>
						myself one time exceeding unworthy, so that <lb/>
						I durst not venture to go to the Holy Com<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> <lb/>
						I called upon a pious Clergyman to whom  <lb/>
						I opened my whole mind. He comforted me <lb/>
						by saying: My dear Friend, even such as you <lb/>
						are, the Lord Jesus calls to come, for he <lb/>
						says: "Come until me all ye that labor &amp; <lb/>
						are heavy laden &amp; I will give you rest; <lb/>

						for I am meek &amp; lowly in heart, &amp; ye <lb/>

						&amp; comfort. During the time when I ex- <lb/>
						perienced <add place="above">endured</add> much persecution, I felt a  <lb/>
						great desire to become acquainted with <lb/>
						a genuine child of God, if there were <lb/>

						and weeping, I perceived a hill on the top of <lb/>
						which was a cavity, which when I perceived, I <lb/>
						rejoiced, thinking this a suitable place, in which <lb/>
						I could pour out my whole soul before the Lord, <lb/>
						unobserved as I thought by any one. I em- <lb/>
						braced this opportunity with gratitude, &amp; <lb/>
						kneeling down, prayed with fervor to our Saviour, <lb/>
						mentioning to him all my concerns, intreating <lb/>
						him with great earnestness, if there was any <lb/>
						genuine child of God in the world, he would <lb/>
						bring him to me, or me to him, in order  <lb/>
						that we might become acquainted, during <lb/>
						which prayer I felt richly comforted with <lb/>
						his divine presence. Whilst I was at prayer, <lb/>
						it happened that 2 persons belonging to the <lb/>
						B<hi rend="superscript">rn's</hi> Cong<hi rend="superscript">n</hi> came that way, &amp; when they <lb/>

						heard the sound of a voice, &amp; the one observed <lb/>
						to the other, that there was a poor sinner <lb/>
						praying to our Saviour. Let us (said they,) <lb/>
						not disturb him. One of them however, <lb/>
						came softly &amp; unperceived by me, to the <lb/>
						summit, &amp; knew me, as I was in a public <lb/>
						line of business. I did not, at that time, <lb/>
						know that there was such a people as the <lb/>
						United Brn, nor even that there were any <lb/>
						awakened in Gottenburg who were so near to <lb/>

						invited me to pay him a visit. I thanked <lb/>

						I had no time to spare, &amp; if I had any I <lb/>
						knew how to make a better use of it; for <lb/>
						I found to be enticed to enter into worldly <lb/>
						amusements. However he came in the sequel <lb/>
						to visit me occasionally, &amp; one Sunday called <lb/>
						a little before service time, on purpose <lb/>
						that he might be with me alone. When <lb/>
						all were gone to Church, he said to me, <lb/>
						My Friend, I believe you to be a person <lb/>

						would it not be well if we were better <lb/>
						acquainted? I was struck with astonish- <lb/>
						ment, &amp; explained: What! are you a child <lb/>
						of God? he answered with a friendly mien, <lb/>
						Yes. I said: then the Lord has heard my <lb/>
						prayers. I rejoiced exceedingly, fell about <lb/>
						his neck &amp; wept for joy. He said: <lb/>
						Will you, my Friend, come &amp; see me now. <lb/>
						I replied yes, that I will with all my <lb/>
						heart, &amp; God willing this day. He then <lb/>
						gave me a ticket that I might not <lb/>
						be hindered by the Porter when entering <lb/>

						have easily ran away I stopped, thinking that <lb/>
						I was not on the <add place="above">right</add> road, altho' it appeared to me <lb/>
						like a public path. When the Gentleman <lb/>
						came up to me, he immediately pulled off <lb/>
						my cloak, &amp; gave it in anger to his servant, <lb/>
						adding who gave you leave to walk here? <lb/>
						I replied humbly that I had not known I <lb/>
						was trespassing, &amp; begged pardon, while at <lb/> 
						the same time I unbuttoned my coat, with <lb/>
						a view to give him that also, calling to <lb/>
						mind our Saviour's words: Him that <lb/>
						taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to take <lb/>
						thy coat also; upon which his anger sub- <lb/>
						sided. I then asked permission to return, <lb/>

						may proceed. He refused however to take <lb/>

						in the Royal Apothecary's shop in Stock- <lb/>

						King &amp; Royal Family were prepared, as <lb/>

						as many B<hi rend="superscript">rn</hi> were in Stockholm, &amp; <lb/>

						I got acquainted with the King's chap- <lb/>

							we arrived safe &amp; well in Stockholm.</p>
					<p>
						In this city, I frequently visited the pa- <lb/>

						as they had many friends in the Town who <lb/>

						a few days Thanking them for their <lb/>
						kindness to strangers, as we were to <lb/>
						them, we replied that it was our in- <lb/>

						induce us to proceed in such a step? I <lb/>
						added, that altho' I might probably <lb/>

						the gospel to the Negro slaves &amp; endeavour to be <lb/>
						instrumental in turning them from darkness to <lb/>

						whom he truly loved, &amp; in whom he had found  <lb/>
						pardon, peace &amp; eternal life. In those  <lb/>
						Diaries which he kept during his abode <lb/>
						in that Island, it appears that he was <lb/>
						earnestly solicitous to promote the happiness <lb/>
						of those souls committed to his care, &amp; that <lb/>
						during his services there, he endured not  <lb/>
						only many hardships, but also escaped <lb/>
						many dangers, but it was apparent that <lb/>
						none of these things moved him, neither <lb/>
						counted he his life dear unto himself, <lb/>
						so that he might finish his course <lb/>
						with joy, &amp; the ministry which he had <lb/>
						received of the Lord Jesus Christ, to testi- <lb/>
						fy the gospel of the grace of God. A few  <lb/>
						extracts out of his diaries will suffice <lb/>
						to show his state of heart &amp; mind. He <lb/>
						writes thus: “By degrees I got also my  <lb/>
						choice of sufferings, but which, in due <lb/>

						I had to ride out both in the day &amp; <lb/>
						night time, in attending the sick, <lb/>
						which wearied me often to such a degree, <lb/>

						cannot recollect even once to have refrined <lb/>

					<p>
						In the time of Rebellion among the  <lb/>
						Negroes, when many white people lost <lb/>
						their lives, I never took any weapons of <lb/>

						advised by many to do so, &amp; yet I always <lb/> 
						escaped unhurt to my own astonishment,  <lb/>
						I generally replied to such advice, I trust <lb/>

						Another time I arrived at an old building <lb/>

						Several years back, his recollection began <lb/>

						grew weaker, but his soul continued alive in <lb/>
						those great &amp; momentous subjects upon which <lb/>
